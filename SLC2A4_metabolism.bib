abstract = {Metastasis requires tumor cell dissemination to different organs from the primary tumor. Dissemination is a complex cell motility phenomenon that requires the molecular coordination of the protrusion, chemotaxis, invasion and contractility activities of tumor cells to achieve directed cell migration. Recent studies of the spatial and temporal activities of the small GTPases have begun to elucidate how this coordination is achieved. The direct visualization of the pathways involved in actin polymerization, invasion and directed migration in dissemination competent tumor cells will help identify the molecular basis of dissemination and allow the design and testing of more specific and selective drugs to block metastasis.},

@article{Golshani-Hebroni1997,
abstract = {Current thought is that proliferating cells undergo a shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism, where the energy requirements of the rapidly dividing cell are provided by ATP from glycolysis. Drawing on the hexokinase-mitochondrial acceptor theory of insulin action, this article presents evidence suggesting that the increased binding of hexokinase to porin on mitochondria of cancer cells not only accelerates glycolysis by providing hexokinase with better access to ATP, but also stimulates the TCA cycle by providing the mitochondrion with ADP that acts as an acceptor for phosphoryl groups. Furthermore, this acceleration of the TCA cycle stimulates protein synthesis via two mechanisms: first, by increasing ATP production, and second, by provision of certain amino acids required for protein synthesis, since the amino acids glutamate, alanine, and aspartate are either reduction products or partially oxidized products of the intermediates of glycolysis and the TCA cycle. The utilization of oxygen in the course of the TCA cycle turnover is relatively diminished even though TCA cycle intermediates are being consumed. With partial oxidation of TCA cycle intermediates into amino acids, there is necessarily a reduction in formation of CO2 from pyruvate, seen as a relative diminution in utilization of oxygen in relation to carbon utilization. This has been assumed to be an inhibition of oxygen uptake and therefore a diminution of TCA cycle activity. Therefore a switch from oxidative metabolism to glycolytic metabolism has been assumed (the Crabtree effect). By stimulating both ATP production and protein synthesis for the rapidly dividing cell, the binding of hexokinase to mitochondrial porin lies at the core of proliferative energy metabolism. This article further reviews literature on the binding of the isozymes of hexokinase to porin, and on the evolution of insulin, proposing that intracellular insulin-like proteins directly bind hexokinase to mitochondrial porin.},

abstract = {Malignant cells exhibit increased rates of glycolysis and glucose uptake, and several types of cancer have been reported to overexpress the GLUT1 glucose transporter. The diagnosis of malignancy in body cavity effusions remains a dilemma in certain cases, despite recent progress in diagnostic immunocytochemistry. We used immunostaining to detect the facilitative glucose transporter, GLUT1, in cytologic preparations of body cavity effusions and washes. With the use of standard avidin-biotin immunostaining for GLUT1, we examined cell blocks of body cavity effusions or washings from 31 carcinomas, 1 lymphoma, and 25 benign effusions or washes. GLUT1 staining occurred in the malignant cell population in 29 (93.5{\%}) of 31 carcinomatous effusions or washes. The characteristic staining pattern consisted of dense, linear staining of the plasma membrane, with accentuation at cell-cell borders, with or without cytoplasmic staining. Erythrocytes showed positive GLUT1 membrane staining, consistent with previous reports. Of 25 benign effusions, 20 were nonstaining (excepting erythrocytes), and 5 contained rare single mesothelial cells, with equivocal to very weak membrane staining. Staining of these cells was readily distinguishable from the characteristic strong staining of malignant cells, and these cells were easily distinguished from tumor cells by their benign morphologic characteristics. At least three of these latter five specimens were from patients with cirrhosis. In all of the other cases, mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and other inflammatory cells did not stain. These findings suggest that GLUT1 immunostaining could be useful in diagnostic cytopathology. The findings also suggest that enhanced glycolysis, which requires increased glucose transport, might be a survival adaptation for tumor cells in effusions, a significant number of which are hypoxic.},

abstract = {Endocytosis entails selective packaging of cell-surface proteins, such as receptors for cytokines and adhesion components, in cytoplasmic vesicles (endosomes). The series of sorting events that determines the fate of internalized proteins, either degradation in lysosomes or recycling back to the plasma membrane, relies on intrinsic sequence motifs, posttranslational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation and ubiquitination), and transient assemblies of both Rab GTPases and phosphoinositide-binding proteins. This multicomponent process is enhanced and skewed in cancer cells; we review mechanisms enabling both major drivers of cancer, p53 and Ras, to bias recycling of integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Likewise, cadherins and other junctional proteins of cancer cells are constantly removed from the cell surface, thereby disrupting tissue polarity and instigating motile phenotypes. Mutant forms of RTKs able to evade Cbl-mediated ubiquitination, along with overexpression of the wild-type forms and a variety of defective feedback regulatory loops, are frequently detected in tumors. Finally, we describe pharmacological attempts to harness the peculiar endocytic system of cancer, in favor of effective patient treatment.},

abstract = {The impairment of apoptotic pathways represents an efficient mechanism to promote chemoresistance in cancer cells. We previously showed that in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, long isoform of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP(L)) accounts for apoptosis resistance in a context of functional p53 and resistance could be overcome by c-FLIP(L) downmodulation. Here, we studied the association between c-FLIP(L) and p53 expressions and their prognostic impact in EOC patients. Tumor tissue from 207 patients diagnosed with primary EOC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for c-FLIP(L) and p53 expressions, and multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) was used to evaluate the multivariable pattern of association among patients' clinical-pathological characteristics and biological determinants. IHC revealed c-FLIP(L) expression and p53 nuclear accumulation inversely related (P = 0.0001; odds ratio = 0.29, confidence interval (CI) = 0.15-0.055). MCA indicated that p53 accumulation was associated to clinical-pathological variables, while c-FLIP(L) expression contributed to the overall association pattern independently from other's clinical characteristics and complementary to p53. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a reduced survival time according to c-FLIP(L) expression in concert with p53 accumulation (median overall survival (OS): 35 months) compared with lack of expression of both markers (median OS: 110 months; log-rank test, P value = 0.024). The multivariable Cox regression model, adjusted for known prognostic factors, identified c-FLIP(L) expression, but not p53 nuclear accumulation, as an independent prognostic factor for adverse outcome (hazard ratio = 1.82, 95{\%} CI = 1.17-2.82; P = 0.008). Altogether these data support the independent contribution of c-FLIP(L) in refining the prognostic information obtained from standard clinical-pathological indicators, confirming its pivotal role in promoting cell survival.},

abstract = {Dietary glucose is taken up by skeletal muscle through GLUT4 (glucose transporter 4). We recently identified by MS proteins displaying insulin-dependent co-precipitation with Myc-tagged GLUT4 from L6 myotubes, including GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and HKII (hexokinase-II). In the present paper we explored whether GAPDH and HKII interact directly with cytoplasmic regions of GLUT4 and their possible inter-relationship. Endogenous and recombinant GAPDH and HKII bound to a chimeric protein linearly encoding all three cytosolic domains of GLUT4 [GST (glutathione-transferase)-GLUT4-cyto]. Both proteins bound to a lesser extent the middle cytosolic loop but not individual N- or C-terminal domains of GLUT4. Purified GAPDH and HKII competed for binding to GST-GLUT4-cyto; ATP increased GAPDH binding and decreased HKII binding to this construct. The physiological significance of the GAPDH-GLUT4 interaction was explored by siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated GAPDH knockdown. Reducing GAPDH expression by 70{\%} increased HKII co-precipitation with GLUT4-Myc from L6 cell lysates. GAPDH knockdown had no effect on surface-exposed GLUT4-Myc in basal or insulin-stimulated cells, but markedly and selectively diminished insulin-stimulated 3-O-methyl glucose uptake and GLUT4-Myc photolabelling with ATB-BMPA {\{}2-N-[4-(1-azitrifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis-(D-mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine{\}}, suggesting that the exofacial glucose-binding site was inaccessible. The results show that GAPDH and HKII reciprocally interact with GLUT4 and suggest that these interactions regulate GLUT4 intrinsic activity in response to insulin.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the presence of high levels of glucose leads to an array of down-regulatory effects known as glucose repression. This process is complex due to the presence of feedback loops and crosstalk between different pathways, complicating the use of intuitive approaches to analyze the system.

RESULTS: We established a logical model of yeast glucose repression, formalized as a hypergraph. The model was constructed based on verified regulatory interactions and it includes 50 gene transcripts, 22 proteins, 5 metabolites and 118 hyperedges. We computed the logical steady states of all nodes in the network in order to simulate wildtype and deletion mutant responses to different sugar availabilities. Evaluation of the model predictive power was achieved by comparing changes in the logical state of gene nodes with transcriptome data. Overall, we observed 71{\%} true predictions, and analyzed sources of errors and discrepancies for the remaining.

CONCLUSION: Though the binary nature of logical (Boolean) models entails inherent limitations, our model constitutes a primary tool for storing regulatory knowledge, searching for incoherencies in hypotheses and evaluating the effect of deleting regulatory elements involved in glucose repression.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs offer tools to identify and treat invasive cancers. Using highly invasive isogenic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells, established using in vitro and in vivo selection protocols from poorly invasive parental cell populations, we used microarray expression analysis to identify a relative and specific decrease in miR-491-5p in invasive cells. Lower expression of miR-491-5p correlated with poor overall survival of patients with OSCCs. miR-491-5p overexpression in invasive OSCC cells suppressed their migratory behavior in vitro and lung metastatic behavior in vivo. We defined the G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1)-as a direct target gene for miR-491-5p control. GIT1 overexpression was sufficient to rescue miR-491-5p-mediated inhibition of migration/invasion and lung metastasis. Conversely, GIT1 silencing phenocopied the ability of miR-491-5p to inhibit migration/invasion and metastasis of OSCC cells. Mechanistic investigations indicated that miR-491-5p overexpression or GIT1 attenuation reduced focal adhesions, with a concurrent decrease in steady-state levels of paxillin, phospho-paxillin, phospho-FAK, EGF/EGFR-mediated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) activation, and MMP2/9 levels and activities. In clinical specimens of OSCCs, GIT1 levels were elevated relative to paired normal tissues and were correlated with lymph node metastasis, with expression levels of miR-491-5p and GIT1 correlated inversely in OSCCs, where they informed tumor grade. Together, our findings identify a functional axis for OSCC invasion that suggests miR-491-5p and GIT1 as biomarkers for prognosis in this cancer.},

METHODS: The dose effects of deguelin on metastasis of oral cancer cells were analyzed by in vitro invasion assay and an orthotropic xenograft mouse model. The involvement of TNF-$\alpha$-induced NF-$\kappa$B signaling was examined by Western blot and reporter assay.

RESULTS: Low-dose deguelin, which has minimal cytotoxicity, significantly inhibited the invasion and migration of oral cancer cells. These inhibitory effects of low-dose deguelin were mediated by suppressing TNF-$\alpha$-induced activation of IkB kinase leading to the inhibition of I$\kappa$B phosphorylation, NF-$\kappa$B transcriptional activity and matrix metalloproteinase-2 expression. The low-dose deguelin treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and invasion without systemic toxicity.

CONCLUSIONS: The low-dose deguelin suppressed the invasion and migration of oral cancer by down-regulating TNF-$\alpha$-induced NF-$\kappa$B signaling. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proton Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy (MRS) is a widely available technique for those clinical centres equipped with MR scanners. Unlike the rest of MR-based techniques, MRS yields not images but spectra of metabolites in the tissues. In pathological situations, the MRS profile changes and this has been particularly described for brain tumours. However, radiologists are frequently not familiar to the interpretation of MRS data and for this reason, the usefulness of decision-support systems (DSS) in MRS data analysis has been explored.

RESULTS: This work presents the INTERPRET DSS version 3.0, analysing the improvements made from its first release in 2002. Version 3.0 is aimed to be a program that 1st, can be easily used with any new case from any MR scanner manufacturer and 2nd, improves the initial analysis capabilities of the first version. The main improvements are an embedded database, user accounts, more diagnostic discrimination capabilities and the possibility to analyse data acquired under additional data acquisition conditions. Other improvements include a customisable graphical user interface (GUI). Most diagnostic problems included have been addressed through a pattern-recognition based approach, in which classifiers based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were trained and tested.

CONCLUSIONS: The INTERPRET DSS 3.0 allows radiologists, medical physicists, biochemists or, generally speaking, any person with a minimum knowledge of what an MR spectrum is, to enter their own SV raw data, acquired at 1.5 T, and to analyse them. The system is expected to help in the categorisation of MR Spectra from abnormal brain masses.},

abstract = {Naringenin, a flavonoid found in high concentrations in grapefruit, has been reported to have antioxidant, antiatherogenic, and anticancer effects. Effects on lipid and glucose metabolism have also been reported. Naringenin is structurally similar to the polyphenol resveratrol, that has been reported to activate the SIRT1 protein deacetylase and to have antidiabetic properties. In the present study we examined the direct effects of naringenin on skeletal muscle glucose uptake and investigated the mechanism involved. Naringenin stimulated glucose uptake in L6 myotubes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Maximum stimulation was seen with 75 microM naringenin for 2 h (192.8+/-24{\%}, p{\textless}0.01), a response comparable to maximum insulin response (190.1+/-13{\%}, p{\textless}0.001). Similar to insulin, naringenin did not increase glucose uptake in myoblasts indicating that GLUT4 glucose transporters may be involved in the naringenin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, naringenin did not have a significant effect on basal or insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation while significantly increased AMPK phosphorylation/activation. Furthermore, silencing of AMPK, using siRNA approach, abolished the naringenin-stimulated glucose uptake. The SIRT1 inhibitors nicotinamide and EX527 did not have an effect on naringenin-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation and glucose uptake. Our data show that naringenin increases glucose uptake by skeletal muscle cells in an AMPK-dependent manner.},

We investigated the effects of hypoxia in tumor phenotype using immunocompetent murine HNSCC models. Balb/c mice were injected intraorally with murine squamous cell carcinoma cells LY-2 and B4B8. Intratumoral hypoxia fraction was evaluated by the immunohistochemical detection of hypoxic probe pimonidazole and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX). Tumor cell apoptosis and autophagy in hypoxic areas of these tumors were examined immunohistochemically. Hypoxia-induced apoptotic and autophagic responses in vitro were examined by treating LY2 cells with CoCl(2). B4B8 tumors exhibited a non-aggressive phenotype characterized by its slow growth rate and the lack of metastatic spread. LY2 tumors demonstrated an aggressive phenotype characterized by rapid growth rate with regional and distant metastasis. Intratumoral hypoxia fraction in B4B8 tumors was significantly lower than in LY2 tumors. The hypoxic areas in B4B8 tumors exhibited increased apoptosis rate than that of LY2 tumors. In contrast, the hypoxic areas in LY2 tumors revealed autophagy. The induction of hypoxia in vitro elicited autophagy and not apoptosis in LY2 cells. The induction of autophagy coupled with blockage of apoptosis in hypoxic areas promotes tumor cell survival and confers aggressive phenotype in immunocompetent murine HNSCC models.},

abstract = {We assessed the effects of different classes of flavonoids on insulin-stimulated 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H]glucose uptake by mouse MC3T3-G2/PA6 cells differentiated into mature adipose cells. Among the flavonoids examined, the flavones, apigenin and luteolin, the flavonols, kaempferol, quercetin and fisetin, an isoflavone, genistein, a flavanonol, silybin, and the flavanols, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and theaflavins, significantly inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. Key structural features of flavonoids for inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake are the B-ring 4'- or 3',4'-OH group and the C-ring C2-C3 double bond of the flavones and flavonols, the A-ring 5-OH of isoflavones, and the galloyl group of EGCG and theaflavins. Luteolin significantly inhibits insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of insulin receptor-beta subunit (IR-beta), and apigenin, kaempferol, quercetin and fisetin, also tended to inhibit the IR-beta phosphorylation. On the other hand, isoflavones, flavanols or flavanonols did not affect insulin-stimulated IR-beta phosphorylation. Apigenin, luteolin, kaempferol, quercetin and fisetin also appeared to inhibit insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, a pivotal downstream effector of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and suppressed insulin-dependent translocation of a glucose transporter, (GLUT)4, into the plasma membrane. Although genistein, silybin, EGCG and theaflavins had no effect on the insulin-stimulated activation of Akt, they blocked insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. These results provide novel insights into the modulation by flavonoids of insulin's actions, including glucose uptake in adipocytes.},

abstract = {Propensity for subsequent distant metastasis in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) was analysed using 186 primary tumours from patients initially treated by surgery that developed (M) or did not develop (NM) metastases as the first recurrent event. Transcriptome (Affymetrix HGU133{\_}Plus2, QRT-PCR) and array-comparative genomic hybridization data were collected. Non-supervised hierarchical clustering based on Affymetrix data distinguished tumours differing in pathological differentiation, and identified associated functional changes. Propensity for metastasis was not associated with these subgroups. Using QRT-PCR data we identified a four-gene model (PSMD10, HSD17B12, FLOT2 and KRT17) that predicts M/NM status with 77{\%} success in a separate 79-sample validation group of HNSCC samples. This prediction is independent of clinical criteria (age, lymph node status, stage, differentiation and localization). The most significantly altered transcripts in M versus NM were significantly associated to metastasis-related functions, including adhesion, mobility and cell survival. Several genomic modifications were significantly associated with M/NM status (most notably gains at 4q11-22 and Xq12-28; losses at 11q14-24 and 17q11 losses) and partly linked to transcription modifications. This work yields a basis for the development of prognostic molecular signatures, markers and therapeutic targets for HNSCC metastasis.},

@article{Tibbles1999,
abstract = {Part of the cellular response to toxins, physical stresses and inflammatory cytokines occurs by signalling via the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 reactivating kinase pathways. This results in modification of cellular gene expression. These stress-responsive kinase pathways are structurally similar, but functionally distinct, from the archetypal mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs or ERKs). The ERK pathway is a hierarchical cascade originating at the cell membrane with receptors for mitogens or growth factors, which recruit, via adapter proteins and exchange factors, the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Ras (see fig. 1). Ras activates raf, a serine threonine kinase, which activates MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase). MEK, in turn, phosphorylates and activates ERK1 and ERK2, which translocate to the nucleus and transactivate transcription factors, changing gene expression to promote growth, differentiation or mitosis. By transducing signals through a cascade of kinases, several options for control are introduced for amplifying and/or modifying the output signal. The SAPK and p38 pathways are also hierarchically arranged, but less is known about the upstream components and the downstream effects of stimulation of these pathways. Among the processes modulated by stress-responsive pathways are apoptosis, transformation, development, immune activation, inflammation and adaptation to environmental changes. This review outlines the upstream componentry of these pathways that interact with a variety of agonists to modify the activity of SAPK and p38, and explores the downstream functions of this activation.},

These functions are required for glucose uptake by insulin-stimulated adipocytes. We sought to determine whether Nef alters adipocyte glucose homeostasis. Using radiolabeled glucose, we found that adipocytes exposed to recombinant Nef took in 42{\%} less glucose after insulin stimulation than did control cells. This reduction resulted from a Nef-dependent inhibition of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) trafficking, as assessed by means of immunofluorescence microscopy. Immunoblot analysis revealed a decrease in phosphorylation of signal transducing proteins after Nef treatment, and fluorescence microscopy showed a dramatic alteration in cortical actin organization. We conclude that Nef interferes with insulin-stimulated processes in adipocytes. We have identified HIV Nef, which is detectable and antigenic in serum samples from HIV-infected people, as a novel contributor to the development of insulin resistance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To explore patterns of Notch receptor and ligand expression in response to radiation that could be crucial in defining optimal dosing schemes for $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors if combined with radiation.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Using MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines, we used real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to study the Notch pathway in response to radiation.

RESULTS: We show that Notch receptor and ligand expression during the first 48 hours after irradiation followed a complex radiation dose-dependent pattern and was most pronounced in mammospheres, enriched for breast cancer stem cells. Additionally, radiation activated the Notch pathway. Treatment with a $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor prevented radiation-induced Notch family gene expression and led to a significant reduction in the size of the breast cancer stem cell pool.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that, if combined with radiation, $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors may prevent up-regulation of Notch receptor and ligand family members and thus reduce the number of surviving breast cancer stem cells.},

abstract = {Genome regulatory proteins (e.g., repressors or polymerases) that function by binding to specific chromosomal target base pair sequences (e.g., operators or promoters) can appear to arrive at their targets at faster than diffusion-controlled rates. These proteins also exhibit appreciable affinity for nonspecific DNA, and thus this apparently facilitated binding rate must be interpreted in terms of a two-step binding mechanism. The first step involves free diffusion to any nonspecific binding site on the DNA, and the second step comprises a series of protein translocation events that are also driven by thermal fluctuations. Because of nonspecific binding, the search process in the second step is of reduced dimensionality (or volume); this results in an accelerated apparent rate of target location. In this paper we define four types of processes that may be involved in these protein translocation events between DNA sites. These are (i) "macroscopic" dissociation--reassociation processes within the domain of the DNA molecule, (ii) "microscopic" dissociation--reassociation events between closely spaced sites in the DNA molecule, (iii) "intersegment transfer" (via "ring-closure") processes between different segments of the DNA molecule, and (iv) "sliding" along the DNA molecule. We present mathematical and physical descriptions of each of these processes, and the consequences of each for the overall rate of target location are worked out as a function of both the nonspecific binding affinity between protein and DNA and the length of the DNA molecule containing the target sequence. The theory is developed in terms of the Escherichia coli lac repressor--operator interaction since data for testing these approaches are available for this system [Barkley, M. (1981) Biochemistry 20, 3833; Winter, R. B., {\&} von Hippel, P. H. (1981) Biochemistry (second paper of three in this issue); Winter, R. B., Berg, O. G., {\&} von Hippel, P. H. (1981) Biochemistry (third paper of three in this issue)]. However, we emphasize that this approach is general for the analysis of mechanisms of biological target location involving facilitated transfer processes via nonspecific binding to the general system of which the target forms a small part.},

abstract = {Modeling of tumor growth has been performed according to various approaches addressing different biocomplexity levels and spatiotemporal scales. Mathematical treatments range from partial differential equation based diffusion models to rule-based cellular level simulators, aiming at both improving our quantitative understanding of the underlying biological processes and, in the mid- and long term, constructing reliable multi-scale predictive platforms to support patient-individualized treatment planning and optimization. The aim of this paper is to establish a multi-scale and multi-physics approach to tumor modeling taking into account both the cellular and the macroscopic mechanical level. Therefore, an already developed biomodel of clinical tumor growth and response to treatment is self-consistently coupled with a biomechanical model. Results are presented for the free growth case of the imageable component of an initially point-like glioblastoma multiforme tumor. The composite model leads to significant tumor shape corrections that are achieved through the utilization of environmental pressure information and the application of biomechanical principles. Using the ratio of smallest to largest moment of inertia of the tumor material to quantify the effect of our coupled approach, we have found a tumor shape correction of 20{\%} by coupling biomechanics to the cellular simulator as compared to a cellular simulation without preferred growth directions. We conclude that the integration of the two models provides additional morphological insight into realistic tumor growth behavior. Therefore, it might be used for the development of an advanced oncosimulator focusing on tumor types for which morphology plays an important role in surgical and/or radio-therapeutic treatment planning.},

abstract = {Tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$-converting enzyme (TACE) is responsible for the shedding of cell surface TNF. Studies suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate up-regulation of TACE activity by direct oxidization or modification of the protein. However, these investigations have been largely based upon nonphysiological stimulation of promonocytic cell lines which may respond and process TACE differently from primary cells. Furthermore, investigators have relied upon TACE substrate shedding as a surrogate for activity quantification. We addressed these concerns, employing a direct, cell-based fluorometric assay to investigate the regulation of TACE catalytic activity on freshly isolated primary human monocytes during LPS stimulation. We hypothesized that ROS mediate up-regulation of TACE activity indirectly, by activation of intracellular signaling pathways. LPS up-regulated TACE activity rapidly (within 30 min) without changing cell surface TACE expression. Scavenging of ROS or inhibiting their production by flavoprotein oxidoreductases significantly attenuated LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation. Exogenous ROS (H2O2) also up-regulated TACE activity with similar kinetics and magnitude as LPS. H2O2- and LPS-induced TACE activity up-regulation were effectively abolished by a variety of selective p38 MAPK inhibitors. Activation of p38 was redox-sensitive as H2O2 caused p38 phosphorylation, and ROS scavenging significantly reduced LPS-induced phospho-p38 expression. Inhibition of the p38 substrate, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, completely attenuated TACE activity up-regulation, whereas inhibition of ERK had little effect. Lastly, inhibition of cell surface oxidoreductases prevented TACE activity up-regulation distal to p38 activation. In conclusion, our data indicate that in primary human monocytes, ROS mediate LPS-induced up-regulation of TACE activity indirectly through activation of the p38 signaling pathway.},

abstract = {Akt, also known as protein kinase B, plays key roles in cell proliferation, survival and metabolism. Akt hyperactivation contributes to many pathophysiological conditions, including human cancers, and is closely associated with poor prognosis and chemo- or radiotherapeutic resistance. Phosphorylation of Akt at S473 (ref. 5) and T308 (ref. 6) activates Akt. However, it remains unclear whether further mechanisms account for full Akt activation, and whether Akt hyperactivation is linked to misregulated cell cycle progression, another cancer hallmark. Here we report that Akt activity fluctuates across the cell cycle, mirroring cyclin A expression. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of S477 and T479 at the Akt extreme carboxy terminus by cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2)/cyclin A or mTORC2, under distinct physiological conditions, promotes Akt activation through facilitating, or functionally compensating for, S473 phosphorylation. Furthermore, deletion of the cyclin A2 allele in the mouse olfactory bulb leads to reduced S477/T479 phosphorylation and elevated cellular apoptosis. Notably, cyclin A2-deletion-induced cellular apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells is partly rescued by S477D/T479E-Akt1, supporting a physiological role for cyclin A2 in governing Akt activation. Together, the results of our study show Akt S477/T479 phosphorylation to be an essential layer of the Akt activation mechanism to regulate its physiological functions, thereby providing a new mechanistic link between aberrant cell cycle progression and Akt hyperactivation in cancer.},

Aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect links the high rate of glucose fermentation to cancer. Together with glutamine, glucose via glycolysis provides the carbon skeletons, NADPH, and ATP to build new cancer cells, which persist in hypoxia that in turn rewires metabolic pathways for cell growth and survival. Excessive caloric intake is associated with an increased risk for cancers, while caloric restriction is protective, perhaps through clearance of mitochondria or mitophagy, thereby reducing oxidative stress. Hence, the links between metabolism and cancer are multifaceted, spanning from the low incidence of cancer in large mammals with low specific metabolic rates to altered cancer cell metabolism resulting from mutated enzymes or cancer genes.},

abstract = {In L6 myotubes, redistribution of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged GLUT4 (HA-GLUT4) to the cell surface occurs rapidly in response to insulin stimulation and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. We have examined whether these separate signaling pathways have a convergent mechanism that leads to GLUT4 mobilization and to changes in GLUT4 recycling. HA antibody uptake on GLUT4 in the basal steady state reached a final equilibrium level that was only 81{\%} of the insulin-stimulated level. AMPK activators (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxyamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and A-769662) led to a similar level of antibody uptake to that found in insulin-stimulated cells. However, the combined responses to insulin stimulation and AMPK activation led to an antibody uptake level of approximately 20{\%} above the insulin level. Increases in antibody uptake due to insulin, but not AICAR or A-769662, treatment were reduced by both wortmannin and Akt inhibitor. The GLUT4 internalization rate constant in the basal steady state was very rapid (0.43 min(-1)) and was decreased during the steady-state responses to insulin (0.18 min(-1)), AICAR (0.16 min(-1)), and A-769662 (0.24 min(-1)). This study has revealed a nonconvergent mobilization of GLUT4 in response to activation of Akt and AMPK signaling. Furthermore, GLUT4 trafficking in L6 muscle cells is very reliant on regulated endocytosis for control of cell surface GLUT4 levels.},

abstract = {Platinum-based drugs, and in particular cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (best known as cisplatin), are employed for the treatment of a wide array of solid malignancies, including testicular, ovarian, head and neck, colorectal, bladder and lung cancers. Cisplatin exerts anticancer effects via multiple mechanisms, yet its most prominent (and best understood) mode of action involves the generation of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA damage response and the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis. Despite a consistent rate of initial responses, cisplatin treatment often results in the development of chemoresistance, leading to therapeutic failure. An intense research has been conducted during the past 30 years and several mechanisms that account for the cisplatin-resistant phenotype of tumor cells have been described. Here, we provide a systematic discussion of these mechanism by classifying them in alterations (1) that involve steps preceding the binding of cisplatin to DNA (pre-target resistance), (2) that directly relate to DNA-cisplatin adducts (on-target resistance), (3) concerning the lethal signaling pathway(s) elicited by cisplatin-mediated DNA damage (post-target resistance) and (4) affecting molecular circuitries that do not present obvious links with cisplatin-elicited signals (off-target resistance). As in some clinical settings cisplatin constitutes the major therapeutic option, the development of chemosensitization strategies constitute a goal with important clinical implications.},

abstract = {Ultraviolet light A (UVA) plays an important role in the etiology of human skin cancer, and UVA-induced signal transduction has a critical role in UVA-induced skin carcinogenesis. The upstream signaling pathways leading to p70(S6K) phosphorylation and activation are not well understood. Here, we observed that UVA induces phosphorylation and activation of p70(S6K). Further, UVA-stimulated p70(S6K) activity and phosphorylation at Thr(389) were blocked by wortmannin, rapamycin, PD98059, SB202190, and dominant negative mutants of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase p85 subunit (DNM-Deltap85), ERK2 (DNM-ERK2), p38 kinase (DNM-p38), and JNK1 (DNM-JNK1) and were absent in Jnk1-/- or Jnk2-/- knockout cells. The p70(S6K) phosphorylation at Ser(411) and Thr(421)/Ser(424) was inhibited by rapamycin, PD98059, or DNM-ERK2 but not by wortmannin, SB202190, DNM-Deltap85, or DNM-p38. However, Ser(411), but not Thr(421)/Ser(424) phosphorylation, was suppressed in DNM-JNK1 and abrogated in Jnk1-/- or Jnk2-/- cells. In vitro assays indicated that Ser(411) on immunoprecipitated p70(S6K) proteins is phosphorylated by active JNKs and ERKs, but not p38 kinase, and Thr(421)/Ser(424) is phosphorylated by ERK1, but not ERK2, JNKs, or p38 kinase. Moreover, p70(S6K) co-immunoprecipitated with PI 3-kinase and possibly PDK1. The complex possibly possessed a partial basal level of phosphorylation, but not at MAPK sites, which was available for its activation by MAPKs in vitro. Thus, these results suggest that activation of MAPKs, like PI 3-kinase/mTOR, may be involved in UVA-induced phosphorylation and activation of p70(S6K).},

abstract = {Rapidly proliferating and neoplastically transformed cells generate the energy required to support rapid cell division by increasing glycolysis and decreasing flux through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, usually without alterations in mitochondrial function. In contrast, little is known of the metabolic alterations, if any, which occur in cells harboring mutations that prime their neoplastic transformation. To address this question, we used a Pten-deficient mouse model to examine thyroid cells where a mild hyperplasia progresses slowly to follicular thyroid carcinoma. Using this model, we report that constitutive phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activation caused by PTEN deficiency in nontransformed thyrocytes results in a global downregulation of Krebs cycle and OXPHOS gene expression, defective mitochondria, reduced respiration, and an enhancement in compensatory glycolysis. We found that this process does not involve any of the pathways classically associated with the Warburg effect. Moreover, this process was independent of proliferation but contributed directly to thyroid hyperplasia. Our findings define a novel metabolic switch to glycolysis driven by PI3K-dependent AMPK inactivation with a consequent repression in the expression of key metabolic transcription regulators.},

Recently, circulating cell-free (ccf) mtDNA in blood has emerged on the platform as a non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for many forms of solid tumors. Accumulating evidence demonstrate that plasma or serum ccf mtDNA levels are significantly different between cancer patients and healthy individuals. Furthermore, quantification of ccf mtDNA levels in circulation may assist in identifying patients from cancer-free healthy population. This minireview attempts to summarize our recent findings in this very promising field of cancer research. The potential technical challenges that we have encountered during the quantitative analysis of ccf mtDNA and mtDNA in general are also briefly discussed. Prospective studies with a larger cohort of patients in various cancer entities are beneficial to precisely define the clinical importance of assessing the ccf mtDNA amount for diagnosing and tracking malignant diseases and their progression.},

abstract = {Objective: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known for its high incidence of neck lymph node metastasis, which represents poor prognosis. Nobiletin is a citrus polymethoxyflavonoid that suppresses tumor growth and metastasis, both of which depend on angiogenesis in previous studies. However, the effect of Nobiletin on human NPC cells metastasis has not been clearly clarified. Research design and methods: In this study, we determine the effects of Nobiletin on the migration and invasion in NPC cells. Results: Nobiletin significantly inhibited migration/invasion capacities of HONE-1 and NPC-BM cell lines. The results of gelatin zymography and western blotting revealed that the activities and protein levels of the MMP-2 were inhibited by Nobiletin. Nobiletin also showed that inhibits phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Tests of the real-time PCR and promoter assays evaluated the inhibitory effects of Nobiletin on MMP-2 expression in human NPC cells. Nobiletin inhibits MMP-2 expression, up-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 and down-regulation of the transcription factors of NF-$\kappa$B and activator protein 1 (AP-1) signaling pathways. Finally, an administration of Nobiletin effectively suppressed the tumor formation and metastasis in the NPC xenograft model in vivo. Conclusions: Nobiletin may have potential use as a chemo-preventive agent against nasopharyngeal cancer metastasis.},

abstract = {At least three different glucose transport systems exist in mammalian cells. These are: (1) the constitutively active, facilitative carrier characteristic of human erythrocytes, Hep G2 (ref. 2) cells and rat brain; (2) the Na-dependent active transporter of kidney and small intestine; and (3) the facilitative carrier of rat liver (B. Thorens and H. F. Lodish, personal communication). A fourth possible glucose transport system is the insulin-dependent carrier that may be specific to muscle and adipose tissue. This transporter resides primarily in an intracellular compartment in resting cells from where it translocates to the cell surface upon cellular insulin exposure. This raises the question of whether hormonal regulation of glucose transport is conferred by virtue of a tissue-specific signalling mechanism or a tissue-specific glucose transporter. Here we present data supporting the latter concept based upon a monoclonal antibody against the fat cell glucose transporter that identifies a unique, insulin-regulatable glucose transport protein in muscle and adipose tissue.},

abstract = {To evaluate the risk factors for local relapse in vulvar cancer patients and its impact on survival as a function of its different patterns, which include local recurrences at the primary tumor site, recurrences remote from the primary tumor, and skin bridge recurrences. Between January 1978 and June 1999, 215 patients were treated for vulvar squamous cell carcinoma. The median follow-up was 38 months. To evaluate the role of local relapse in survival, a Cox regression multivariable analysis was performed using local relapse as a time-dependent covariate. The local relapse-free survival rate was 78.6{\%} (+/- 7.1{\%}) at 5 years. Multivariable analyses showed that the local relapse was increased by the factors margin status and depth of invasion. Pathologic nodal status, tumor size, margin status, and depth of invasion were predictors of cancer-related death in the Cox multivariable model with fixed covariates. The contribution of local relapse for disease-specific survival at the site of the primary tumor (relative risk [RR] 6.35; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 2.07, 15.76) or skin bridge recurrence (RR 6.48; 95{\%} CI 2.54, 16.49) was highly significant, whereas the contribution of local relapse at the other sites was not (RR 2.29; 95{\%} CI 0.53, 9.91). In this model, margin status was not significant. The risk of cancer-related death after local relapse was 58.4{\%} (+/- 18.3{\%}) at 1 year and 70.9{\%} (+/- 17.6{\%}) at 3 years.Local relapses at the site of the primary tumor or skin bridge recurrences are strong predictors for cancer-related death, but not local relapse at a distant site.},

abstract = {Exercise can increase skeletal muscle sensitivity to insulin, improve insulin resistance and regulate glucose homeostasis in rat models of type 2 diabetes. However, the potential mechanism remains poorly understood. In this study, we established a male Sprague-Dawley rat model of type 2 diabetes, with insulin resistance and $\beta$ cell dysfunction, which was induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin to replicate the pathogenesis and metabolic characteristics of type 2 diabetes in humans. We also investigated the possible mechanism by which chronic and acute exercise improves metabolism, and the phosphorylation and expression of components of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and downstream components of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathways in the soleus. As a result, blood glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, and free fatty acid were significantly increased, whereas insulin level progressively declined in diabetic rats. Interestingly, chronic and acute exercise reduced blood glucose, increased phosphorylation and expression of AMPK$\alpha$1/2 and the isoforms AMPK$\alpha$1 and AMPK$\alpha$2, and decreased phosphorylation and expression of AMPK substrate, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). Chronic exercise upregulated phosphorylation and expression of AMPK upstream kinase, LKB1. But acute exercise only increased LKB1 expression. In particular, exercise reversed the changes in protein kinase C (PKC)$\zeta$/$\lambda$ phosphorylation, and PKC$\zeta$ phosphorylation and expression. Additionally, exercise also increased protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt1, Akt2 and GLUT4 expression, but AS160 protein expression was unchanged. Chronic exercise elevated Akt (Thr(308)) and (Ser(473)) and AS160 phosphorylation. Finally, we found that exercise increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ coactivator 1 (PGC1) mRNA expression in the soleus of diabetic rats. These results indicate that both chronic and acute exercise influence the phosphorylation and expression of components of the AMPK and downstream to PIK3 (aPKC, Akt), and improve GLUT4 trafficking in skeletal muscle. These data help explain the mechanism how exercise regulates glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats.},

abstract = {Cancer cells are metabolically stressed during tumour progression due to limited tumour vascularity and resultant nutrient, growth factor and oxygen deficiency that can induce cell death and inhibit tumour growth. We demonstrate that Rab25, a small GTPase involved in endosomal recycling, that is genomically amplified in multiple tumour lineages, is a key regulator of cellular bioenergetics and autophagy. RAB25 enhanced survival during nutrient stress by preventing apoptosis and autophagy via binding and activating AKT leading to increased glucose uptake and improved cellular bioenergetics. Unexpectedly, Rab25 induced the accumulation of glycogen in epithelial cancer cells, a process not previously identified. Strikingly, an increase in basal ATP levels combined with AKT-dependent increases in glucose uptake and glycogen storage allowed maintenance of ATP levels during bioenergetic stress. The clinical relevance of these findings was validated by the ability of a Rab25-dependent expression profile enriched for bioenergetics targets to identify patients with a poor prognosis. Thus, Rab25 is an unexpected regulator of cellular bioenergetics implicated as a useful biomarker and potential therapeutic target.},

These techniques are of particular interest for the study of the outcome dependence from several variables measured on a continuous scale, since they allow for the detection of complex non-linear and non-additive effects. Few efforts have been made until now to account for censored times in FFANNs. In the attempt to fill this gap, specific error functions and data representation will be introduced for multilayer perceptron and radial basis function extensions of generalized linear models for survival data.},

abstract = {AIM: The roles of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and myocyte enhancer factor 2 isoforms (MEF2A, D) as mediators of the effects of ethanol on glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) expression are unclear. We studied the effects of ethanol in adipocytes in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were divided into three groups and given ethanol in a single daily dose of 0, 0.5, or 5 g/kg for 22 weeks. The expression of AMPK, MEF2 isoforms A and D, and GLUT4 was measured and compared in the three groups. The existence of the AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway in adipocytes and the effects of ethanol on this pathway were studied in (a) epididymal adipose tissue from six male Wistar rats subcutaneously injected with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR, an AMPK activator) or with 0.9{\%} NaCl (control); and (b) isolated rat and human adipocytes treated with or without ethanol, AICAR, and compound C (a selective AMPK inhibitor). Expression of AMPK, MEF2, and GLUT4 was measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: (1) Long-term ethanol exposure decreased activated AMPK, MEF2A, MEF2D, and GLUT4 expression in rat adipose tissue. (2) In rat and human adipocytes, AICAR-induced AMPK activation, with subsequent elevation of MEF2 and GLUT4 expression, was inhibited by compound C. (3) In vitro ethanol-treatment suppressed the AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway. CONCLUSION: The AMPK/MEF2/GLUT4 pathway exists in both rat and human adipocytes, and activated AMPK may positively regulate MEF2 and GLUT4 expression. Ethanol inhibition of this pathway leads to decreased GLUT4 expression, thus reducing insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) images are usually quantitatively analyzed in "whole-tumor" volumes of interest. Also parameters determined with dynamic PET acquisitions, such as the Patlak glucose metabolic rate (MR(glc)) and pharmacokinetic rate constants of two-tissue compartment modeling, are most often derived per lesion. We propose segmentation of tumors to determine tumor heterogeneity, potentially useful for dose-painting in radiotherapy and elucidating mechanisms of FDG uptake.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: In 41 patients with 104 lesions, dynamic FDG-PET was performed. On MR(glc) images, tumors were segmented in quartiles of background subtracted maximum MR(glc) (0{\%}-25{\%}, 25{\%}-50{\%}, 50{\%}-75{\%}, and 75{\%}-100{\%}). Pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model in the three segments with highest MR(glc) to determine the rate constants of FDG metabolism.

RESULTS: From the highest to the lowest quartile, significant decreases of uptake (K(1)), washout (k(2)), and phosphorylation (k(3)) rate constants were seen with significant increases in tissue blood volume fraction (V(b)).

CONCLUSIONS: Tumor regions with highest MR(glc) are characterized by high cellular uptake and phosphorylation rate constants with relatively low blood volume fractions. In regions with less metabolic activity, the blood volume fraction increases and cellular uptake, washout, and phosphorylation rate constants decrease. These results support the hypothesis that regional tumor glucose phosphorylation rate is not dependent on the transport of nutrients (i.e., FDG) to the tumor.},

abstract = {Apoptosis induced by low potassium (K5) or staurosporine in cerebellar granule neurons triggers an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. ROS inhibition by antioxidants or inhibitors of the NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity reduces the apoptosis induced by both stimuli. It has been reported that JNK mediates the apoptosis induced by K5 but not by staurosporine. No information is available about the role of other signaling pathways such as p38 in staurosporine-induced apoptosis, and whether p38 activation could be related to ROS levels induced by both K5 and staurosporine. Here, we explored this possibility and found that K5 activates p38 and ATF2 and that the inhibition of p38 activity prevents the apoptosis induced by this treatment. We also found that p38 is downstream of ROS generation induced by K5. On the other hand, staurosporine promotes a sustained activation of p38. We found that p38 inhibition markedly decreases ROS generation, NOX activity and apoptosis induced by staurosporine. Furthermore, antioxidants inhibit p38 activation induced by staurosporine. These data indicate that apoptosis induced by both K5 and staurosporine is dependent on p38 activation, which is mediated by ROS. In addition, p38 activation by staurosporine induces a further production of ROS through NOX activation.},

abstract = {The expression of glucose transporter genes (GLUTI-4) was studied in 20 head-and-neck tumors of 18 patients. All tumors--16 of which were squamous-cell carcinomas (SCC)--expressed GLUT1 and/or GLUT3 mRNA, while detectable levels of GLUT2 or GLUT4 mRNA were not observed. The signals for GLUT1 and GLUT3 mRNAs varied markedly throughout the SCC tumor population but no clear relationship with the grade of differentiation was found. The high GLUT expression observed in some tumors was not associated with amplification or rearrangement of the corresponding genes. Immunohistochemistry of 5 SCCs showed that GLUT1 protein was located in tumor-cell membranes in relation to the level of mRNA expression. We conclude that both GLUT1 and GLUT3 are involved in basal glucose uptake of extracranial head-and-neck tumors. The increased expression of these high-affinity GLUT isoforms may be related to the growth maintenance of cancer tissue in cases of limited supply of substrate e.g., in poorly vascularized tumor areas.},

abstract = {Epidemiologic evidence suggests that high dietary intake of Brassica vegetables, such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts, protects against tumorigenesis in multiple organs. 3,3′-Diindolylmethane, one of the active products derived from Brassica vegetables, is a promising antitumor agent. Previous studies in our laboratory showed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane induced a G1 cell cycle arrest in human breast cancer MCF-7 cells by a mechanism that included increased expression of p21. In the present study, the upstream events leading to p21 overexpression were further investigated. We show for the first time that 3,3′-diindolylmethane is a strong mitochondrial H+-ATPase inhibitor (IC50∼20 $\mu$mol/L). 3,3′-Diindolylmethane treatment induced hyperpolarization of mitochondrial inner membrane, decreased cellular ATP level, and significantly stimulated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. ROS production, in turn, led to the activation of stress-activated pathways involving p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase. Using specific kinase inhibitors (SB203580 and SP600125), we showed the central role of p38 and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways in 3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced p21 mRNA transcription. In addition, antioxidants significantly attenuated 3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced activation of p38 and JNK and induction of p21, indicating that oxidative stress is the major trigger of these events. To further support the role of ROS in 3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced p21 overexpression, we showed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane failed to induce p21 overexpression in mitochondrial respiratory chain deficient $\rho$0 MCF-7 cells, in which 3,3′-diindolylmethane did not stimulate ROS production. Thus, we have established the critical role of enhanced mitochondrial ROS release in 3,3′-diindolylmethane-induced p21 up-regulation in human breast cancer cells. (Cancer Res 2006; 66(9): 4880-7) },

abstract = {It is well established that exposure of mammalian cells to hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) suppresses mitochondrial function by inhibiting cytochrome-c oxidase (CcOX; complex IV). However, recent experimental data show that administration of H(2)S to mammalian cells can serve as an electron donor and inorganic source of energy. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of endogenously produced H(2)S in the regulation of mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in isolated liver mitochondria and in the cultured murine hepatoma cell line Hepa1c1c7. Low concentrations of H(2)S (0.1-1 $\mu$M) elicited a significant increase in mitochondrial function, while higher concentrations of H(2)S (3-30 $\mu$M) were inhibitory. The positive bioenergetic effect of H(2)S required a basal activity of the Krebs cycle and was most pronounced at intermediate concentrations of succinate. 3-mercaptopyruvate (3-MP), the substrate of the mitochondrial enzyme 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST) stimulated mitochondrial H(2)S production and enhanced mitochondrial electron transport and cellular bioenergetics at low concentrations (10-100 nM), while at higher concentrations, it inhibited cellular bioenergetics. SiRNA silencing of 3-MST reduced basal bioenergetic parameters and prevented the stimulating effect of 3-MP on mitochondrial bioenergetics. Silencing of sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQR) also reduced basal and 3-MP-stimulated bioenergetic parameters. We conclude that an endogenous intramitochondrial H(2)S-producing pathway, governed by 3-MST, complements and balances the bioenergetic role of Krebs cycle-derived electron donors. This pathway may serve a physiological role in the maintenance of mitochondrial electron transport and cellular bioenergetics.},

abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key mechanism in both embryonic development and cancer metastasis. The EMT introduces stem-like properties to cancer cells. However, during somatic cell reprogramming, mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET), the reverse process of EMT, is a crucial step toward pluripotency. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a multifunctional secreted protein that acts as either an oncoprotein or a tumor suppressor among different cancers. Here, we show that in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), CTGF promotes the MET and reduces invasiveness. Moreover, we found that CTGF enhances the stem-like properties of HNSCC cells and increases the expression of multiple pluripotency genes. Mechanistic studies showed that CTGF induces c-Jun expression through $\alpha$v$\beta$3 integrin and that c-Jun directly activates the transcription of the pluripotency genes NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1. Knockdown of CTGF in TW2.6 cells was shown to reduce tumor formation and attenuate E-cadherin expression in xenotransplanted tumors. In HNSCC patient samples, CTGF expression was positively correlated with the levels of CDH1, NANOG, SOX2, and POU5F1. Coexpression of CTGF and the pluripotency genes was found to be associated with a worse prognosis. These findings are valuable in elucidating the interplay between epithelial plasticity and stem-like properties during cancer progression and provide useful information for developing a novel classification system and therapeutic strategies for HNSCC.},

However, the dissociation of cellular aggregates is not sufficient to explain why cancer cells move, and the motile nature of cancer cells undergoing EMT remains elusive. Here, we identify a mechanism in which the EMT inducer Twist1 elicits cancer cell movement through activation of RAC1. Twist1 cooperates with BMI1 to suppress let-7i expression, which results in upregulation of NEDD9 and DOCK3, leading to RAC1 activation and enabling mesenchymal-mode movement in three-dimensional environments. Moreover, the suppression of let-7i contributes to Twist1-induced stem-like properties. Clinically, activation of the Twist1-let-7i-NEDD9 axis in head and neck cancer patients correlates with tumour invasiveness and worse outcome. Our results uncover an essential mechanism to explain how Twist1 induces the motile stem-like cancer cell phenotype beyond simply suppressing E-cadherin.},

@article{Gasparre2013,
abstract = {Cancer cells are characterized in general by a decrease of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, together with a strong enhancement of glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. The decrease of mitochondrial activity in cancer cells may have multiple reasons, related either to the input of reducing equivalents to the electron transfer chain or to direct alterations of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. In some cases, the depression of respiratory activity is clearly the consequence of disruptive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and leads as a consequence to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By acting both as mutagens and cellular mitogens, ROS may contribute directly to cancer progression. On the basis of our experimental evidence, we suggest a deep implication of the supercomplex organization of the respiratory chain as a missing link between oxidative stress, energy failure, and tumorigenesis. We speculate that under conditions of oxidative stress, a dissociation of mitochondrial supercomplexes occurs, with destabilization of complex I and secondary enhanced generation of ROS, thus leading to a vicious circle amplifying mitochondrial dysfunction. An excellent model to dissect the role of pathogenic, disassembling mtDNA mutations in tumor progression and their contribution to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells (glycolysis vs. respiration) is provided by an often underdiagnosed subset of tumors, namely, the oncocytomas, characterized by disruptive mutations of mtDNA, especially of complex I subunits. Such mutations almost completely abolish complex I activity, which slows down the Krebs cycle, favoring a high ratio of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate/succinate and consequent destabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$). On the other hand, if complex I is partially defective, the levels of NAD(+) may be sufficient to implement the Krebs cycle with higher levels of intermediates that stabilize HIF1$\alpha$, thus favoring tumor malignancy. The threshold model we propose, based on the population-like dynamics of mitochondrial genetics (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies that below threshold complex I is present and functioning correctly, thus favoring tumor growth, whereas above threshold, when complex I is not assembled, tumor growth is arrested. We have therefore termed "oncojanus" the mtDNA genes whose disruptive mutations have such a double-edged effect.},

Developing cells share a proportion of their DHS landscapes with ESCs; that proportion decreases continuously in each cell type as differentiation progresses, providing a quantitative benchmark of developmental maturity. Developmentally stable DHSs densely encode binding sites for transcription factors involved in autoregulatory feedback circuits.

abstract = {Aims/hypothesis Rho GTPases (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 [Rac1] and cell division cycle 42 [Cdc42]) have been shown to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secre-tion (GSIS) via cytoskeletal remodelling, trafficking and fu-sion of insulin-secretory granules with the plasma membrane. GTP loading of these G proteins, which is facilitated by GDP/GTP exchange factors, is a requisite step in the regula-tion of downstream effector proteins. Guanine nucleotide ex-change factor VAV2 (VAV2), a member of the Dbl family of proteins, has been identified as one of the GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rac1. Despite recent evidence on the regulatory roles of VAV2 in different cell types, roles of this guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the signalling events leading to GSIS remain undefined. Using immunological, short interfering RNA (siRNA), pharmacological and microscopic approaches we investigated the role of VAV2 in GSIS from islet beta cells. Methods Co-localisation of Rac1 and VAV2 was determined by Triton X-114 phase partition and confocal microscopy. Glucose-induced actin remodelling was quantified by live cell imaging using the LifeAct-GFP fluorescent biosensor. Rac1 activation was determined by G protein linked immunosor-bent assay (G-LISA). Results Western blotting indicated that VAV2 is expressed in INS-1 832/13 beta cells, normal rat islets and human islets. Vav2 siRNA markedly attenuated GSIS in INS-1 832/13 cells. Ehop-016, a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of the VAV2–Rac1 interaction, or siRNA-mediated knockdown of VAV2 markedly attenuated glucose-induced Rac1 activation and GSIS in INS-1 832/13 cells. Pharmacological findings were recapitulated in primary rat islets. A high glucose con-centration promoted co-localisation of Rac1 and VAV2. Real-time imaging in live cells indicated a significant inhibition of glucose-induced cortical actin remodelling by Ehop-016. Conclusions/Interpretation Our data provide the first evi-dence to implicate VAV2 in glucose-induced Rac1 activation, actin remodelling and GSIS in pancreatic beta cells.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancers have been shown to have increased glucose uptake and utilization, and to express the facilitative glucose transporter Glut1. The aim of this study was to determine the biological significance of Glut1 expression in breast cancer. METHODS: Paraffin sections of 118 breast cancers were immunostained with antibody to Glut1. The percent of Glut1-positive cancer cells in each tumor was correlated with known prognostic markers, and with patient outcome. RESULTS: Glut1 was expressed in 42{\%} of the tumors. Glut1 immunoreactivity correlated positively with the proliferative activity as determined by Ki-67 immunostaining, and with the total histologic score, and showed negative correlation with bcl-2 immunostaining. There was no correlation between the percent of Glut1-immunoreactive cancer cells and estrogen receptor status, tumor size, or lymph node status. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Glut1 expression is increased in breast cancers with higher grade and proliferative activity, and 2) glucose transport in the majority of breast cancers may be mediated by a glucose transporters other than Glut1.},

abstract = {The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg effect is increasingly recognized, and glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies. We recently reported the identification of a group of novel small compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism. We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents. Here, we report that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a more than 70{\%} reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin. Mechanism studies showed that WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells (RBC), which express Glut1 as their sole glucose transporter. Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to decreases in levels of Glut1 protein, intracellular ATP, and glycolytic enzymes. All these changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and necrosis. Addition of extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells, suggesting that the reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in the anticancer mechanism of the molecule. Senescence induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells. Thus, WZB117 is a prototype for further development of anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism.},

abstract = {The ability of cancer cells to overproduce lactic acid aerobically was recognized by Warburg about seven decades ago, although its molecular basis has been elusive. Increases in glucose transport and hexokinase activity in cancer cells appear to account for the increased flux of glucose through the cancer cells. Herein we review current findings indicating that the c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) are able to bind the lactate dehydrogenase A promoter cis acting elements, which resemble the core carbohydrate response element (ChoRE), CACGTG. These and other observations suggest that the normal cell responds physiologically to changes in oxygen tension or the availability of glucose by altering glycolysis through the ChoRE, which hypothetically binds c-Myc, HIF-1, or related factors. The neoplastic cell is hypothesized to augment glycolysis by activation of ChoRE/ HIF-1 sites through direct interaction with c-Myc or through activation of HIF-1 or HIF-1-like activity. We hypothesize that oncogene products either stimulate HIF-1 and related factors or, in the case of c-Myc, directly activate hypoxia/glucose responsive elements in glycolytic enzyme genes to increase the ability of cancer cells to undergo aerobic glycolysis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The molecular mechanisms underlying lung inflammation in toxic smoke inhalation injury are unknown. We investigated the signaling pathway responsible for the induction of interleukin 8 by wood smoke extract in lung epithelial cells and lung inflammation induced by wood smoke exposure in mice. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled study. SETTING: A research laboratory. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN RESULTS: Exposure of primary human bronchial epithelial cells to wood smoke extract sequentially activated NADPH oxidase and increased intracellular reactive oxygen species level; activated AMP-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase (two mitogen-activated protein kinases), and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (two transcription factors); and induced interleukin-8. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation with apocynin or siRNA targeting p47(phox ) (a subunit of NADPH oxidase) attenuated the increased intracellular reactive oxygen species level, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and interleukin-8 induction. Removal of intracellular reactive oxygen species by N-acetyl-cysteine reduced the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase, and interleukin-8 induction. Prevention of AMP-activated protein kinase activation by Compound C or AMP-activated protein kinase siRNA lessened the activation of Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, nuclear factor-$\kappa$B, signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 and interleukin-8 induction. Inhibition of Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation by inhibitors reduced the activation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 and interleukin-8 induction. Abrogation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 activation by inhibitors attenuated the interleukin-8 induction. Additionally, acute exposure of mice to wood smoke promoted AMP-activated protein kinase phosphorylation and expression of macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (an interleukin-8 homolog) in lung epithelial cells and lungs and lung inflammation, all of which were reduced by Compound C treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Interleukin-8 induction by wood smoke extract in lung epithelial cells is mediated by novel NADPH oxidase-dependent, reactive oxygen species-sensitive AMP-activated protein kinase signaling with Jun N-terminal kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase as the downstream kinases and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 as the downstream transcription factors. This AMP-activated protein kinase signaling is likely important for inducing lung inflammation with toxic smoke exposure in mice.},

abstract = {The p53 tumor-suppressor plays a critical role in the prevention of human cancer. In the absence of cellular stress, the p53 protein is maintained at low steady-state levels and exerts very little, if any, effect on cell fate. However, in response to various types of stress, p53 becomes activated; this is reflected in elevated protein levels, as well as augmented biochemical capabilities. As a consequence of p53 activation, cells can undergo marked phenotypic changes, ranging from increased DNA repair to senescence and apoptosis. This review deals with the mechanisms that underlie the apoptotic activities of p53, as well as the complex interactions between p53 and central regulatory signaling networks. In p53-mediated apoptosis, the major role is played by the ability of p53 to transactivate specific target genes. The choice of particular subsets of target genes, dictated by covalent p53 modifications and protein-protein interactions, can make the difference between life and apoptotic death of a cell. In addition, transcriptional repression of antiapoptotic genes, as well as transcription-independent activities of p53, can also contribute to the apoptotic effects of p53. Regarding the crosstalk between p53 and signaling networks, this review focuses on the interplay between p53 and two pivotal regulatory proteins: beta-catenin and Akt/PKB. Both proteins can regulate p53 as well as be regulated by it. In addition, p53 interacts with the GSK-3beta kinase, which serves as a link between Akt and beta-catenin. This review discusses how the functional balance between these different interactions might dictate the likelihood of a given cell to become cancerous or be eliminated from the replicative pool, resulting in suppression of cancer.},

Activation of Frizzled-1 by Wnts induces nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and activation of Lef/Tcf-dependent gene expression. Casein kinase 2 has been shown to affect Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. How casein kinase 2 exerts an influence in Wnt signaling is not clear; casein kinase 2 has been reported to be constitutively active (i.e. not regulated). Herein we show to the contrary that casein kinase 2 activity is rapidly and transiently increased in response to Wnt3a stimulation and is essential for Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Chemical inhibition of casein kinase 2 or suppression of its expression blocks Frizzled-1 activation of Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression. Treatment with pertussis toxin or knock down of Galpha(q) or Galpha(o) blocks Wnt stimulation of casein kinase 2 activation, as does suppression of the phosphoprotein Dishevelled, demonstrating that casein kinase 2 is downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins and Dishevelled. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of either Galpha(q) or Galpha(o) stimulates casein kinase 2 activation and Lef/Tcf-sensitive gene expression. Thus, casein kinase 2 is shown to be regulated by Wnt3a and essential to stimulation of the Frizzled-1/beta-catenin/Lef-Tcf pathway.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To characterize the metabolic system of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by metabolome analysis.

STUDY DESIGN: The metabolome profiles, including the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMPP), the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCAC), and amino acids, were obtained from OSCC and its surrounding normal tissues (32 patients) using capillary electrophoresis and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer.

RESULTS: Enhancement of glucose consumption and lactate production (Warburg effect) was observed in OSCC tissues. The decrease of glucose along with the decrease of the downstream intermediates in the EMPP suggests that incorporated glucose is mainly consumed for biosynthesis. Glutamine consumption with the increase of the intermediates in the last half of the TCAC suggests the involvement of glutaminolysis, in which glutamine is converted to lactate via the last half of the TCAC.

CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that OSCC tissues show the Warburg effect, which stems from the combined enhancement of glucose consumption and glutaminolysis.},

abstract = {NPGPx is a member of the glutathione peroxidase (GPx) family; however, it lacks GPx enzymatic activity due to the absence of a critical selenocysteine residue, rendering its function an enigma. Here, we show that NPGPx is a newly identified stress sensor that transmits oxidative stress signals by forming the disulfide bond between its Cys57 and Cys86 residues. This oxidized form of NPGPx binds to glucose-regulated protein (GRP)78 and forms covalent bonding intermediates between Cys86 of NPGPx and Cys41/Cys420 of GRP78. Subsequently, the formation of the disulfide bond between Cys41 and Cys420 of GRP78 enhances its chaperone activity. NPGPx-deficient cells display increased reactive oxygen species, accumulated misfolded proteins, and impaired GRP78 chaperone activity. Complete loss of NPGPx in animals causes systemic oxidative stress, increases carcinogenesis, and shortens life span. These results suggest that NPGPx is essential for releasing excessive ER stress by enhancing GRP78 chaperone activity to maintain physiological homeostasis.},

abstract = {Here we used the Met-1 cell line in an orthotopic transplantation model in FVB/N mice to dissect the role of the Cav-1(P132L) mutation in human breast cancer. Identical experiments were performed in parallel with wild-type Cav-1. Cav-1(P132L) up-regulated the expression of estrogen receptor-alpha as predicted, because only estrogen receptor-alpha-positive patients have been shown to harbor Cav-1(P132L) mutations. In the context of primary tumor formation, Cav-1(P132L) behaved as a loss-of-function mutation, lacking any tumor suppressor activity. In contrast, Cav-1(P132L) caused significant increases in cell migration, invasion, and experimental metastasis, consistent with a gain-of-function mutation. To identify possible molecular mechanism(s) underlying this invasive gain-of-function activity, we performed unbiased gene expression profiling. From this analysis, we show that the Cav-1(P132L) expression signature contains numerous genes that have been previously associated with cell migration, invasion, and metastasis. These include i) secreted growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins (Cyr61, Plf, Pthlh, Serpinb5, Tnc, and Wnt10a), ii) proteases that generate EGF and HGF (Adamts1 and St14), and iii) tyrosine kinase substrates and integrin signaling/adapter proteins (Akap13, Cdcp1, Ddef1, Eps15, Foxf1a, Gab2, Hs2st1, and Itgb4). Several of the P132L-specific genes are also highly expressed in stem/progenitor cells or are associated with myoepithelial cells, suggestive of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. These results directly support clinical data showing that patients harboring Cav-1 mutations are more likely to undergo recurrence and metastasis.},

abstract = {Genomic findings underscore the heterogeneity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of mutations that predict therapeutic response would be a major advance. We determined the mutationally altered, targetable mitogenic pathways in a large HNSCC cohort. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from 151 tumors revealed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to be the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway (30.5{\%}). PI3K pathway-mutated HNSCC tumors harbored a significantly higher rate of mutations in known cancer genes. In a subset of human papillomavirus-positive tumors, PIK3CA or PIK3R1 was the only mutated cancer gene. Strikingly, all tumors with concurrent mutation of multiple PI3K pathway genes were advanced (stage IV), implicating concerted PI3K pathway aberrations in HNSCC progression. Patient-derived tumorgrafts with canonical and noncanonical PIK3CA mutations were sensitive to an mTOR/PI3K inhibitor (BEZ-235), in contrast to PIK3CA-wild-type tumorgrafts. These results suggest that PI3K pathway mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment selection.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma is one of numerous malignancies characterized by increased glucose consumption, a phenomenon with significant prognostic implications in this disease. Few studies have focused on elucidating the molecular underpinnings of glucose transporter (GLUT) activation in cancer, knowledge that could facilitate identification of promising therapeutic targets. To address this issue, we performed gene expression profiling studies involving myeloma cell lines and primary cells as well as normal lymphocytes to uncover deregulated GLUT family members in myeloma. Our data demonstrate that myeloma cells exhibit reliance on constitutively cell surface-localized GLUT4 for basal glucose consumption, maintenance of Mcl-1 expression, growth, and survival. We also establish that the activities of the enigmatic transporters GLUT8 and GLUT11 are required for proliferation and viability in myeloma, albeit because of functionalities probably distinct from whole-cell glucose supply. As proof of principle regarding the therapeutic potential of GLUT-targeted compounds, we include evidence of the antimyeloma effects elicited against both cell lines and primary cells by the FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which exerts a selective off-target inhibitory effect on GLUT4. Our work reveals critical roles for novel GLUT family members and highlights a therapeutic strategy entailing selective GLUT inhibition to specifically target aberrant glucose metabolism in cancer.},

This is the first study to compare p53 values in both primary tumor and surgical margin tissues of the same patients with early glottic cancers.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the prognostic value of p53 expression in the surgical margins of early glottic cancers treated with external laryngeal surgery in the prediction of local recurrences.

METHODS: Fifteen patients with early glottic cancer with local recurrences (group 1) and 15 without any recurrences (group 2) were included in the study. p53 expression was determined in both the tumor and the tumor-negative surgical margins.

RESULTS: Median p53 in the primary tumor was 55{\%} (interquartile range (IQR) = 67) and 5{\%} (IQR = 71) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.178). Median p53 in the surgical margin was 11{\%} (IQR = 13) and 2{\%} (IQR = 2) in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.001). In the logistic regression analysis only surgical margin p53 value was significant in the prediction of recurrences (odds ratio (OR) = 1.68, 95{\%} CI = 1.1-2.6, p = 0.017). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve was 0.86 (p = 0.002) and 0.65 (p = 0.180) in the surgical margin and the primary tumor, respectively.},

Here we demonstrate that the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) has a prominent role in basal glucose uptake in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We show that shRNA-mediated down-regulation of GLUT4 diminishes glucose uptake and induces metabolic reprogramming by reallocating metabolic flux to oxidative phosphorylation. This reallocation is reflected on an increased activity of the mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate and lower lactate release. Altogether, GLUT4 inhibition compromises cell proliferation and critically affects cell viability under hypoxic conditions, providing proof-of-principle for the feasibility of using pharmacological approaches to inhibit GLUT4 in order to induce metabolic reprogramming in vivo in breast cancer models. {\textcopyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The search for physiological mechanisms that downregulate activated immune cells has revealed a critical role for extracellular adenosine and for immunosuppressive A2A adenosine receptors in protecting tissue from inflammatory damage. Tissue damage–associated deep hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factors, and hypoxia-induced accumulation of adenosine may represent one of the most fundamental and immediate tissue-protecting mechanisms, with adenosine A2A receptors triggering “OFF” signals in activated immune cells. In these regulatory mechanisms, oxygen deprivation and extracellular adenosine accumulation serve as “reporters,” while A2A adenosine receptors serve as “sensors” of excessive tissue damage. The A2A receptor–triggered generation of intracellular cAMP then inhibits activated immune cells in a delayed negative feedback manner to prevent additional tissue damage. Targeting A2A adenosine receptors may have important clinical applications.},

We have identified an additional Pthlh variant, consisting of Thr and three amino-acid changes in the C-terminus (Pthlh(SerAspTyr)), carried by an evolutionarily distant Mus spretus (SPRET/Ei) inbred strain. When transfected into NCI-H520 tumor cells, this Pthlh(SerAspTyr) variant did not stimulate tumor growth in nude mice. Analysis of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion patterns of Pthlh(Pro)-, Pthlh(Thr)-, and Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected NCI-H520 cells revealed a 1.5-fold decrease in adhesion efficiency on both collagen type I and Matrigel, and a 5-6-fold increase in migration capability in Pthlh(Pro) transfectants as compared to nontransfected, vector-transfected, Pthlh(Thr)-, or Pthlh(SerAspTyr)-transfected cells. These findings suggest that the cancer modifier effects of the mouse Pthlh gene are mediated by differential cell adhesion and migration effects of PTHrP variants.},

Chronic administration of D-galactose has been reported to cause deterioration of cognitive and motor skills that are similar to symptoms of aging and, therefore, is regarded as a model of accelerated aging. Because enhancing endogenous antioxidants is now widely regarded as an attractive therapy for conditions associated with mitochondrial oxidative stress, in the present study the effects of $\alpha$-lipoic acid, L-carnitine, and PMX-500F on D-galactose treated mice were tested. Female mice were injected with (100 mg/kg) D-(+)-galactose for 6 weeks and some groups were treated with a daily dose of $\alpha$-lipoic acid (5 mg/kg), L-carnitine (3.9 mg/kg), PMX-500F (11.9 mg/kg), or the vehicle (0.1 M Tris, pH 7.4). Control mice were treated with physiological saline. An accelerating Rota-Rod, open field test, and Y-maze test were performed, and serum lactate concentrations were analyzed. These analyses did not identify impairment in motor coordination, open-field activity, or spatial memory (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Similarly, serum lactate concentrations in D-galactose-treated mice were not elevated when compared to controls (p {\textgreater} 0.05). Treatment with the antioxidant compounds at the given concentrations did not result in any changes in the behavioral parameters tested. In conclusion, results of this study illustrate that chronic, short-term D-galactose treatment may not represent a suitable model for inducing readily detectable age-related neurobehavioral symptoms in mice.},

abstract = {Altered metabolism in tumor cells is increasingly recognized as a core component of the neoplastic phenotype. Because p53 has emerged as a master metabolic regulator, we hypothesized that the presence of wild-type p53 in glioblastoma cells could confer a selective advantage to these cells under the adverse conditions of the glioma microenvironment. Here, we report on the effects of the p53-dependent effector Tp53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) on hypoxia-induced cell death. We demonstrate that TIGAR is overexpressed in glioblastomas and that ectopic expression of TIGAR reduces cell death induced by glucose and oxygen restriction. Metabolic analyses revealed that TIGAR inhibits glycolysis and promotes respiration. Further, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was reduced whereas levels of reduced glutathione were elevated in TIGAR-expressing cells. Finally, inhibiting the transketolase isoenzyme transketolase-like 1 (TKTL1) by siRNA reversed theses effects of TIGAR. These findings suggest that glioma cells benefit from TIGAR expression by (i) improving energy yield from glucose via increased respiration and (ii) enhancing defense mechanisms against ROS. Targeting metabolic regulators such as TIGAR may therefore be a valuable strategy to enhance glioma cell sensitivity toward spontaneously occurring or therapy-induced starvation conditions or ROS-inducing therapeutic approaches.},

It was found that Fe@Au caused an irreversible membrane-potential loss in the mitochondria of cancer cells, but only a transitory decrease in membrane potential in healthy control cells. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed; however, additions of common ROS scavengers were unable to protect cancerous cells from the Fe@Au-induced cytotoxicity.

abstract = {Breast cancers are thought to be organized hierarchically with a small number of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) able to regrow a tumor while their progeny lack this ability. Recently, several groups reported enrichment for BCSCs when breast cancers were subjected to classic anticancer treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this enrichment are incompletely understood. Using non-BCSCs sorted from patient samples, we found that ionizing radiation reprogrammed differentiated breast cancer cells into induced BCSCs (iBCSCs). iBCSCs showed increased mammosphere formation, increased tumorigenicity, and expressed the same stemness-related genes as BCSCs from nonirradiated samples. Reprogramming occurred in a polyploid subpopulation of cells, coincided with re-expression of the transcription factors Oct4, sex determining region Y-box 2, Nanog, and Klf4, and could be partially prevented by Notch inhibition. We conclude that radiation may induce a BCSC phenotype in differentiated breast cancer cells and that this mechanism contributes to increased BCSC numbers seen after classic anticancer treatment.},

abstract = {The resistance of residual cancer cells after oncological resection to adjuvant chemoradiotherapies results in both high recurrence rates and high non-specific tissue toxicity, thus preventing the successful treatment of such cancers as head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The patients' survival rate and quality of life therefore depend upon the efficacy, selectivity and low non-specific toxicity of the adjuvant treatment. We report a novel, theranostic in vivo technology that unites both the acoustic diagnostics and guided intracellular delivery of anti-tumor drug (liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin, Doxil) in one rapid process, namely a pulsed laser-activated plasmonic nanobubble (PNB). HNSCC-bearing mice were treated with gold nanoparticle conjugates, Doxil, and single near-infrared laser pulses of low energy. Tumor-specific clusters of gold nanoparticles (solid gold spheres) converted the optical pulses into localized PNBs. The acoustic signals of the PNB detected the tumor with high specificity and sensitivity. The mechanical impact of the PNB, co-localized with Doxil liposomes, selectively ejected the drug into the cytoplasm of cancer cells. Cancer cell-specific generation of PNBs and their intracellular co-localization with Doxil improved the in vivo therapeutic efficacy from 5-7{\%} for administration of only Doxil or PNBs alone to 90{\%} thus demonstrating the synergistic therapeutic effect of the PNB-based intracellular drug release. This mechanism also reduced the non-specific toxicity of Doxil below a detectable level and the treatment time to less than one minute. Thus PNBs combine highly sensitive diagnosis, overcome drug resistance and minimize non-specific toxicity in a single rapid theranostic procedure for intra-operative treatment.},

abstract = {The collective migration of cells as a cohesive group is a hallmark of the tissue remodelling events that underlie embryonic morphogenesis, wound repair and cancer invasion. In such migration, cells move as sheets, strands, clusters or ducts rather than individually, and use similar actin- and myosin-mediated protrusions and guidance by extrinsic chemotactic and mechanical cues as used by single migratory cells. However, cadherin-based junctions between cells additionally maintain 'supracellular' properties, such as collective polarization, force generation, decision making and, eventually, complex tissue organization. Comparing different types of collective migration at the molecular and cellular level reveals a common mechanistic theme between developmental and cancer research.},

abstract = {Many anticancer drugs activate caspases via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Activation of this pathway triggers a concomitant bioenergetic crisis caused by the release of cytochrome-c (cyt-c). Cancer cells are able to evade these processes by altering metabolic and caspase activation pathways. In this study, we provide the first integrated system study of mitochondrial bioenergetics and apoptosis signalling and examine the role of mitochondrial cyt-c release in these events. In accordance with single-cell experiments, our model showed that loss of cyt-c decreased mitochondrial respiration by 95{\%} and depolarised mitochondrial membrane potential $\Delta$$\Psi$(m) from -142 to -88 mV, with active caspase-3 potentiating this decrease. ATP synthase was reversed under such conditions, consuming ATP and stabilising $\Delta$$\Psi$(m). However, the direction and level of ATP synthase activity showed significant heterogeneity in individual cancer cells, which the model explained by variations in (i) accessible cyt-c after release and (ii) the cell's glycolytic capacity. Our results provide a quantitative and mechanistic explanation for the protective role of enhanced glucose utilisation for cancer cells to avert the otherwise lethal bioenergetic crisis associated with apoptosis initiation.},

abstract = {Contractile activity during physical exercise induces an increase in GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle, helping to improve glucose transport capacity and insulin sensitivity. An important mechanism by which exercise upregulates GLUT4 is through the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in response to elevated levels of cytosolic Ca(2+) during muscle contraction. This review discusses the mechanism by which Ca(2+) activates CaMKII, explains research techniques currently used to alter CaMK activity in cells, and highlights various exercise models and pharmacological agents that have been used to provide evidence that CaMKII plays an important role in regulating GLUT4 expression. With regard to transcriptional mechanisms, the key research studies that identified myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and GLUT4 enhancer factor as the major transcription factors regulating glut4 gene expression, together with their binding domains, are underlined. Experimental evidence showing that CaMK activation induces hyperacetylation of histones in the vicinity of the MEF2 domain and increases MEF2 binding to its cis element to influence MEF2-dependent Glut4 gene expression are also given along with data suggesting that p300 might be involved in acetylating histones on the Glut4 gene. Finally, an appraisal of the roles of other calcium- and non-calcium-dependent mechanisms, including the major HDAC kinases in GLUT4 expression, is also given.},

abstract = {The mechanism linking p53 inactivation to human cell malignancy remains unclear. Studies have indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in carcinogenesis. In this study we investigated the role of p53 in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation and maintenance of proper mitochondrial function. We measured mtDNA mutation and found no difference in frequency of mutation between the p53+/+ and p53-/- cell lines. However, mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COX) activity was significantly diminished in p53-/- cells. This decrease in COX activity was attributed to decreased protein levels of the COXII subunit encoded by the mitochondrial genome and was not due to mutation in the mitochondrial COXII gene. Further investigation revealed no concomitant decrease in COXII mRNA levels in p53-/- cells and the stability of mRNA in p53-/- cells was unaffected. This study suggests that decreased COX activity is likely due to post-transcriptional regulation of the COXII subunit by p53. COX is a critical enzyme in the mitochondrial electron transport chain and reduced COX activity may affect mitochondrial structure. However, examination of mitochondrial ultrastructure revealed no obvious differences between p53+/+ and p53-/- cell lines. Together, our study suggests that p53 is involved in regulation of COXII at the protein level but not at the mRNA level. p53 does not affect mtDNA mutation or mitochondrial ultrastructure.},

abstract = {Sirt5, localized in the mitochondria, is a member of sirtuin family of NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases. Sirt5 was shown to deacetylate and activate carbamoyl phosphate synthase 1. Most recently, Sirt5 was reported to be the predominant protein desuccinylase and demalonylase in the mitochondria because the ablation of Sirt5 enhanced the global succinylation and malonylation of mitochondrial proteins, including many metabolic enzymes. In order to determine the physiological role of Sirt5 in metabolic homeostasis, we generated a germline Sirt5 deficient (Sirt5⁻/⁻) mouse model and performed a thorough metabolic characterization of this mouse line. Although a global protein hypersuccinylation and elevated serum ammonia during fasting were observed in our Sirt5⁻/⁻ mouse model, Sirt5 deficiency did not lead to any overt metabolic abnormalities under either chow or high fat diet conditions. These observations suggest that Sirt5 is likely to be dispensable for the metabolic homeostasis under the basal conditions.},

abstract = {Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a main catechin of green tea, has been suggested to inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis. However, the exact role and related mechanism have not been established. In this study, we examined the role of EGCG in hepatic gluconeogenesis at concentrations that are reachable by ingestion of pure EGCG or green tea, and are not toxic to hepatocytes. Our results show in isolated hepatocytes that EGCG at relatively low concentrations (≤ 1 $\mu$M) inhibited glucose production via gluconeogenesis and expression of key gluconeogenic genes. EGCG was not toxic at these concentrations while demonstrating significant cytotoxicity at 10 $\mu$M and higher concentrations. EGCG at 1 $\mu$M or lower concentrations effective in suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis did not activate the insulin signaling pathway, but activated 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis was prevented by blockade of AMPK activity. In defining the mechanism by which EGCG activates AMPK, we found that the EGCG activation of AMPK was mediated by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK). Furthermore, our results show that the EGCG activation of AMPK and EGCG suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis were both dependent on production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was a known activator of CaMKK. Together, our results demonstrate an inhibitory role for EGCG in hepatic gluconeogenesis and shed new light on the mechanism by which EGCG suppresses gluconeogenesis.},

Important outcomes of the reviewed studies appear to support the hypotheses that the flexibility of a membrane determined by the ratio of (poly)unsaturated to saturated fatty acyl chains of its phospholipids influences the effectiveness of glucose transport by insulin-independent glucose transporters (GLUTs) and the insulin-dependent GLUT4, and from the prediabetic stage on a shift from unsaturated towards saturated fatty acyl chains of membrane phospholipids directly induces a decrease in glucose effectiveness and insulin sensitivity. In addition, it has become evident that a concomitant increase in stiffness of both plasma and erythrocyte membranes may decrease the microcirculatory flow, leading ultimately to tissue hypoxia, insufficient tissue nutrition, and diabetes-specific microvascular pathology. As to the etiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus, a revised hypothesis that attempts to accommodate the reviewed findings is presented.},

abstract = {Malignant cells are known to have accelerated metabolism, high glucose requirements, and increased glucose uptake. Transport of glucose across the plasma membrane of mammalian cells is the first rate-limiting step for glucose metabolism and is mediated by facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) proteins. Increased glucose transport in malignant cells has been associated with increased and deregulated expression of glucose transporter proteins, with overexpression of GLUT1 and/or GLUT3 a characteristic feature. Oncogenic transformation of cultured mammalian cells causes a rapid increase of glucose transport and GLUT1 expression via interaction with GLUT1 promoter enhancer elements. In human studies, high levels of GLUT1 expression in tumors have been associated with poor survival. Studies indicate that glucose transport in breast cancer is not fully explained by GLUT1 or GLUT3 expression, suggesting involvement of another glucose transporter. Recently, a novel glucose transporter protein, GLUT12, has been found in breast and prostate cancers. In human breast and prostate tumors and cultured cells, GLUT12 is located intracellularly and at the cell surface. Trafficking of GLUT12 to the plasma membrane could therefore contribute to glucose uptake. Several factors have been implicated in the regulation of glucose transporter expression in breast cancer. Hypoxia can increase GLUT1 levels and glucose uptake. Estradiol and epidermal growth factor, both of which can play a role in breast cancer cell growth, increase glucose consumption. Estradiol and epidermal growth factor also increase GLUT12 protein levels in cultured breast cancer cells. Targeting GLUT12 could provide novel methods for detection and treatment of breast and prostate cancer.},

abstract = {Biomarkers predicting metastatic capacity might assist the development of better therapeutic strategies for aggressive cancers such as lung cancer. In this study, we show that adenylate kinase-4 (AK4) is a progression-associated gene in human lung cancer that promotes metastasis. Analysis of published microarray data showed that AK4 was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal cells. High AK4 expression was associated with advanced stage, disease recurrence and poor prognosis. Loss of AK4 expression suppressed the invasive potential of lung cancer cell lines, whereas AK4 overexpression promoted invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, the transcription factor ATF3 was identified as a pivotal regulatory target of AK4. Simultaneous reduction in AK4 and ATF3 expression abolished the inhibitory effects of ATF3 on invasion. ATF3 overexpression in AK4-overexpressing cells limits invasion activity. Furthermore, patients with high AK4 and low ATF3 expression showed unfavorable outcomes compared with patients with low AK4 and high ATF3 expression. Taken together, our findings indicated that AK4 promotes malignant progression and recurrence by promoting metastasis in an ATF3-dependent manner.},

abstract = {Cancer cells are characterized in general by a decrease of mitochondrial respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, together with a strong enhancement of glycolysis, the so-called Warburg effect. The decrease of mitochondrial activity in cancer cells may have multiple reasons, related either to the input of reducing equivalents to the electron transfer chain or to direct alterations of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes. In some cases, the depression of respiratory activity is clearly the consequence of disruptive mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations and leads as a consequence to enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). By acting both as mutagens and cellular mitogens, ROS may contribute directly to cancer progression. On the basis of our experimental evidence, we suggest a deep implication of the supercomplex organization of the respiratory chain as a missing link between oxidative stress, energy failure, and tumorigenesis. We speculate that under conditions of oxidative stress, a dissociation of mitochondrial supercomplexes occurs, with destabilization of complex I and secondary enhanced generation of ROS, thus leading to a vicious circle amplifying mitochondrial dysfunction. An excellent model to dissect the role of pathogenic, disassembling mtDNA mutations in tumor progression and their contribution to the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells (glycolysis vs. respiration) is provided by an often underdiagnosed subset of tumors, namely, the oncocytomas, characterized by disruptive mutations of mtDNA, especially of complex I subunits. Such mutations almost completely abolish complex I activity, which slows down the Krebs cycle, favoring a high ratio of $\alpha$-ketoglutarate/succinate and consequent destabilization of hypoxia inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF1$\alpha$). On the other hand, if complex I is partially defective, the levels of NAD(+) may be sufficient to implement the Krebs cycle with higher levels of intermediates that stabilize HIF1$\alpha$, thus favoring tumor malignancy. The threshold model we propose, based on the population-like dynamics of mitochondrial genetics (heteroplasmy vs. homoplasmy), implies that below threshold complex I is present and functioning correctly, thus favoring tumor growth, whereas above threshold, when complex I is not assembled, tumor growth is arrested. We have therefore termed "oncojanus" the mtDNA genes whose disruptive mutations have such a double-edged effect.},

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a transcription factor that mediates adaptive responses to reduced O2 availability, including angiogenesis and glycolysis. Expression of the O2-regulated HIF-1alpha subunit and HIF-1 transcriptional activity are increased dramatically in hypoxic cells. Recent studies indicate that many common tumor-specific genetic alterations also lead to increased HIF-1alpha expression and/or activity.

Insulin increases glucose uptake into fat and muscle cells through the regulated trafficking of vesicles that contain glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4). New insights into insulin signalling reveal that phosphorylation events initiated by the insulin receptor regulate key GLUT4 trafficking proteins, including small GTPases, tethering complexes and the vesicle fusion machinery. These proteins, in turn, control GLUT4 movement through the endosomal system, formation and retention of specialized GLUT4 storage vesicles and targeted exocytosis of these vesicles. Understanding these processes may help to explain the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes and provide new potential therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {Agents targeting EGFR and related ErbB family proteins are valuable therapies for the treatment of many cancers. For some tumor types, including squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN), antibodies targeting EGFR were the first protein-directed agents to show clinical benefit, and remain a standard component of clinical strategies for management of the disease. Nevertheless, many patients display either intrinsic or acquired resistance to these drugs; hence, major research goals are to better understand the underlying causes of resistance, and to develop new therapeutic strategies that boost the impact of EGFR/ErbB inhibitors. In this review, we first summarize current standard use of EGFR inhibitors in the context of SCCHN, and described new agents targeting EGFR currently moving through pre-clinical and clinical development. We then discuss how changes in other transmembrane receptors, including IGF1R, c-Met, and TGF-$\beta$, can confer resistance to EGFR-targeted inhibitors, and discuss new agents targeting these proteins. Moving downstream, we discuss critical EGFR-dependent effectors, including PLC-$\gamma$; PI3K and PTEN; SHC, GRB2, and RAS and the STAT proteins, as factors in resistance to EGFR-directed inhibitors and as alternative targets of therapeutic inhibition. We summarize alternative sources of resistance among cellular changes that target EGFR itself, through regulation of ligand availability, post-translational modification of EGFR, availability of EGFR partners for hetero-dimerization and control of EGFR intracellular trafficking for recycling versus degradation. Finally, we discuss new strategies to identify effective therapeutic combinations involving EGFR-targeted inhibitors, in the context of new system level data becoming available for analysis of individual tumors.},

Here, we demonstrate that the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) has a prominent role in basal glucose uptake in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We show that shRNA-mediated down-regulation of GLUT4 diminishes glucose uptake and induces metabolic reprogramming by reallocating metabolic flux to oxidative phosphorylation. This reallocation is reflected on an increased activity of the mitochondrial oxidation of pyruvate and lower lactate release. Altogether, GLUT4 inhibition compromises cell proliferation and critically affects cell viability under hypoxic conditions, providing proof-of-principle for the feasibility of using pharmacological approaches to inhibit GLUT4 in order to induce metabolic reprogramming in vivo in breast cancer models.},

abstract = {In Taiwan, oral cancer is the sixth leading cause of cancer-related death in year 2006, and it is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in male population on this island. The disease causes great morbidity, and the five-year survival rate of less than 50 {\%} has not improved in more than two decades. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most frequently a occurred cancer in the oral and maxillofacial regions, and its metastatic and invasive abilities tendencies made it difficult in prognostic control. In our study, we determined infection efficiencies in seven oral cancer cell lines and oral mucosa fibroblast (OMF) with different lentivirus dosage. The results suggested that using lentivirus for gene delivery is a promising method. We used 20 MOI GL-lentivirus to infect Ca922 and SAS cell lines to establish stable cell lines with GL expression. The Ca922-GL and SAS-GL orthotopic tumor models were established by these two stable cell lines. Based on bioluminescent imaging observation, SAS was highly invasive cell line, while Ca922-GL was not an invasive cell line in vivo. In SAS-GL orthotopic model, a metastatic tumor was observed on salivary gland. However, in Ca922-GL orthotopic model, no metastatic tumor was found in mice at all. Deguelin is a natural product and an AKT inhibitor. In cell viability assay, Ca922, Cal27, and SAS were sensitive to deguelin. To determine the inhibition efficacy of deguelin treatment on tumor growth, we used SAS-GL orthotopic tumor model with 0.8 mg/kg and 4 mg/kg deguelin treatment. In 4 mg/kg deguelin treatment, the tumor volume in SAS-GL orthotopic tumor model was significantly smaller than the control group. In addition, treatment with 0.8 mg/kg deguelin in SAS-GL orthotopic tumor model also resulted in a smaller tumor. Overall, our results indicated that the tumor growth of oral cancer could be inhibited by deguelin treatment, and this novel strategy may provide an additional treatment for OSCC},

The computational modeling of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions is one systemic and quantitative strategy for characterizing the metabolic phenotype associated with human diseases and potentially for designing drugs with optimal clinical effects. The purpose of this short review is to describe how computational modeling, including the specific case of constraint-based modeling, can be used to explore, characterize, and predict the metabolic capacities that distinguish the metabolic phenotype of cancer cell lines. As we show herein, this computational framework is far from a pure theoretical description, and to ensure proper biological interpretation, it is necessary to integrate high-throughput data and generate predictions for later experimental assessment. Hence, genome-scale modeling serves as a platform for the following: (1) the integration of data from HTs, (2) the assessment of how metabolic activity is related to phenotype in cancer cell lines, and (3) the design of new experiments to evaluate the outcomes of the in silico analysis. By combining the functions described above, we show that computational modeling is a useful methodology to construct an integrative, systemic, and quantitative scheme for understanding the metabolic profiles of cancer cell lines, a first step to determine the metabolic mechanism by which cancer cells maintain and support their malignant phenotype in human tissues.},

@article{Benhar2001,
abstract = {Many primary tumors as well as transformed cell lines display high sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation. The molecular mechanisms that underlie this sensitivity are largely unknown. Here we show that the sensitization of transformed cells to stress stimuli is due to the potentiation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Activation of these pathways by the antitumor drug cis-platin (CDDP) and by other stress agents is markedly enhanced and is induced by lower stress doses in NIH 3T3 cells overexpressing epidermal growth factor receptor, HER1–2 kinase, or oncogenic Ras than in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells. Inhibition of stress kinase activity by specific inhibitors reduces CDDP-mediated cell death in transformed cells, whereas overactivation of stress kinase pathways augments cells death. Potentiation of stress kinases is a common feature of cells transformed by different oncogenes, including cells derived from human tumors, and is shown here to be independent of the activity of the particular transforming oncoprotein. We further show that the mechanism that underlies potentiation of stress kinases in transformed cells involves reactive oxygen species (ROS), whose production is elevated in these cells. JNK/p38 activation is inhibited by antioxidants and in particular by inhibitors of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and NADPH oxidase. Conversely, by artificially elevating ROS levels in nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells we were able to induce potentiation of JNK/p38 activation. Taken together, our findings suggest that ROS-dependent potentiation of stress kinase pathways accounts for the sensitization of transformed cells to stress and anticancer drugs. The expression of oncogenes or the enhanced activity of proto-oncogenes induces unregulated mitosis and cell proliferation in most cell types. Conversely, oncogenic transformation often results in the apparently contradictory phenomenon of sensitization to stress-induced apoptosis. For example, rat embryo fibroblasts transformed by the oncogenic forms of Myc, Mos, Src, or Ras are sensitized to induction of apoptosis by the antitumor drug cis-platin (CDDP) (4). Similarly, transformation of NIH 3T3 cells by oncogenic Src, Ras, or Raf potentiates apoptosis in response to treatment with etoposide (11). In several cases, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or the related HER-2/neu receptor was found to be associated with enhanced sensitivity to CDDP (3, 19). In fact, the enhanced sensitivity of oncogenically transformed cells to these agents forms the basis of present cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, although the enhanced sensitivity of transformed cells is well documented and is of great advantage in the clinic, its molecular basis is not clear. Elucidation of the basis for sensitization of transformed cells to stress is important, since it may further promote our understanding as to why cells from advanced tumors or from tumors that were exposed to chronic chemotherapy often lose this sensitivity and become resistant to apoptotic signals. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family of proteins belongs to distinct and evolutionarily conserved signal transduction pathways that are activated by extracellular stimuli (33, 37, 49). In particular, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK (also referred to as stress-activated protein kinases) pathways are activated by stress agents, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1, heat shock, UV light, gamma radiation, and chemotherapeutic drugs (27, 31, 34, 42, 47, 49). This activation has been shown to correlate with induction of apoptosis by these agents. Studies using dominant negative mutants of JNK and p38 and specific pharmacological inhibitors have shown that JNK and/or p38 activation is necessary for UV-, cytokine-, chemotherapy-, ceramide-, and serum deprivation-induced apoptosis (6, 7, 13, 14, 32, 53, 57). Also, studies on fibroblasts with targeted disruptions of all the functional Jnk genes established an essential role for JNK in UV-induced and other stress-induced apoptosis (50). However, it is not known how oncogenic transformation affects the stress kinase pathways. In view of the important role of JNK and p38 MAPKs in the cellular response to stress, we sought to compare the activation and regulation of these pathways in transformed cells and in nontransformed cells. Here we show that JNK and p38 expression and activity are similar in transformed and nontransformed cell lines under normal growth conditions. Under stress, however, JNK and p38 activation are greatly enhanced in transformed NIH 3T3 cells. For transformed cells, low doses of stress stimuli are sufficient to induce JNK/p38 activation and consequently cell death. We further show that stress kinase potentiation in transformed cells is due to an elevated rate of production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We propose that the ROS-mediated JNK and p38 activation play a key role in the sensitization of oncogenically transformed cells to stress signals and to anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza virus infection causes highly contagious, severe respiratory disorders and gives rise to thousands of deaths every year; however, the efficacy of currently approved defense strategies, including vaccines and neuraminidase inhibitors, is limited because the virus frequently acquires resistance via antigen drift and reassortment. It is therefore important to establish a novel, effective therapeutic strategy that is effective irrespective of viral subtype.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we identify the Ras-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway as a host-cell regulatory mechanism for influenza virus entry. The binding of Ras to PI3K is specifically involved in clathrin-independent endocytosis, endosomal maturation, and intracellular transport of viruses, which result in decreased infectious efficacy of different subtypes of influenza viruses in cells lacking the Ras-PI3K interaction. Moreover, influenza virus infection indeed triggered Ras activation and subsequent PI3K activation in early endosomes.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, these results demonstrate that the Ras-PI3K signaling axis acts as a host-oriented mechanism for viral internalization. Given that virus incorporation is a process conserved among virus subtypes and species, this signaling pathway may provide a target for potent, well-tolerated prophylactics and therapeutics against a broad range of viruses.},

abstract = {Cellular energy metabolism is one of the main processes affected during the transition from normal to cancer cells, and it is a crucial determinant of cell proliferation or cell death. As a support for rapid proliferation, cancer cells choose to use glycolysis even in the presence of oxygen (Warburg effect) to fuel macromolecules for the synthesis of nucleotides, fatty acids, and amino acids for the accelerated mitosis, rather than fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondria biogenesis is also reprogrammed in cancer cells, and the destiny of those cells is determined by the balance between energy and macromolecule supplies, and the efficiency of buffering of the cumulative radical oxygen species. In glioblastoma, the most frequent and malignant adult brain tumor, a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis is observed, with regulation by well known genes as integrants of oncogenic pathways such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase, MYC, and hypoxia regulated gene as hypoxia induced factor 1. The expression profile of a set of genes coding for glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in glioblastoma cases confirms this metabolic switch. An understanding of how the main metabolic pathways are modified by cancer cells and the interactions between oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes with these pathways may enlighten new strategies in cancer therapy. In the present review, the main metabolic pathways are compared in normal and cancer cells, and key regulations by the main oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are discussed. Potential therapeutic targets of the cancer energetic metabolism are enumerated, highlighting the astrocytomas, the most common brain cancer.},

abstract = {Glucose uptake into skeletal muscle is primarily mediated by glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). The number of GLUT4 polypeptides at the surface of muscle cells rises rapidly in response to insulin, contraction, depolarization, or energy deprivation. However, distinct mechanisms underlie the gain in surface GLUT4 in each case. Insulin promotes its exocytosis to the membrane, regulating vesicle movement, tethering, docking, and fusion. In contrast, muscle contraction, depolarization, and energy demand reduce GLUT4 endocytosis. The signals involved in each case also differ. Insulin utilizes Akt, Rabs, and selective actin remodelling, whereas depolarization and energy deprivation engage AMP-activated protein kinase and Ca2+-dependent signals. GLUT4 internalizes via 2 major routes that involve dynamin, but only one requires clathrin. The clathrin-independent route is slowed down by energy deprivation, and is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase. In addition to regulation of the exocytic and endocytic movement of GLUT4, glucose uptake is also modulated through changes in the transporter's intrinsic activity. The glycolytic enzymes glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase and hexokinase II contribute to such regulation, through differential binding to GLUT4.},

Genomic alterations in squamous cell lung cancers have not been comprehensively characterized, and no molecularly targeted agents have been specifically developed for its treatment. As part of The Cancer Genome Atlas, here we profile 178 lung squamous cell carcinomas to provide a comprehensive landscape of genomic and epigenomic alterations. We show that the tumour type is characterized by complex genomic alterations, with a mean of 360 exonic mutations, 165 genomic rearrangements, and 323 segments of copy number alteration per tumour. We find statistically recurrent mutations in 11 genes, including mutation of TP53 in nearly all specimens. Previously unreported loss-of-function mutations are seen in the HLA-A class I major histocompatibility gene. Significantly altered pathways included NFE2L2 and KEAP1 in 34{\%}, squamous differentiation genes in 44{\%}, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway genes in 47{\%}, and CDKN2A and RB1 in 72{\%} of tumours. We identified a potential therapeutic target in most tumours, offering new avenues of investigation for the treatment of squamous cell lung cancers.},

The case group consisted of 104 male and 3 female oral cancer patients and these were compared with 194 male and 6 female matched controls. We found by univariate analysis that alcohol consumption, smoking, betel quid chewing, educational level and occupation were associated with oral cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were to be found elevated in patients who were smoking and betel quid chewing. After adjusting for education and occupation covariates, the incidence of oral cancer was computed to be 123‐fold higher in patients who smoked, drank alcohol and chewed betel quid than in obstainers. The synergistic effects of alcohol, tobacco smoke and betel quid in oral cancer were clearly demonstrated, but there was a statistically significant association between oral cancer and betel quid chewing alone. Swallowing betel quid juice (saliva extract of betel quid produced by chewing) or including unripened betel fruit in the quid both seemed to enhance the risks of contracting oral cancer.

abstract = {Despite progress in treatment approaches for oral cancer, there has been only modest improvement in patient outcomes in the past three decades. The frequent treatment failure is due to the failure to control tumor recurrence and metastasis. These failures suggest that new targets should be identified to reverse oral epithelial dysplastic lesions. Recent developments suggest an active role of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) in various human cancers either as a tumor suppressor or as a tumor promoter. GSK3beta is a Ser/Thr protein kinase, and there is emerging evidence that it is a tumor suppressor in oral cancer. The evidence suggests a link between key players in oral cancer that control transcription, accelerated cell cycle progression, activation of invasion/metastasis and anti-apoptosis, and regulation of these factors by GSK3beta. Moreover, the major upstream kinases of GSK3beta and their oncogenic activation by several etiological agents of oral cancer support this hypothesis. In spite of all this evidence, a detailed analysis of the role of GSK3beta in oral cancer and of its therapeutic potential has yet to be conducted by the scientific community. The focus of this review is to discuss the multitude of roles of GSK3beta, its possible role in controlling different oncogenic events and how it can be targeted in oral cancer.},

abstract = {Regularly performed aerobic exercise leads to increases in skeletal muscle mitochondria and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein content, resulting in an enhanced capacity to oxidize substrates and improvements in insulin- and contraction-mediated glucose uptake. Although the specific mechanisms governing these adaptive responses have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that occurs with each wave of sacrolemmal depolarization is a key component of these processes. Treating L6 muscle cells with agents that increase Ca2+ without causing reductions in {\~{}}P or the activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase leads to increases in GLUT4 and mitochondrial protein contents. This effect is likely controlled through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), since KN93, a specific CaMK inhibitor, blocks these adaptive responses. Recent findings provide evidence that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the pathway through which Ca2+/CaMK mediates mitochondrial and GLUT4 biogenesis. p38 MAPK initiates GLUT4 and mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Subsequent increases in the content of these proteins further enhance Ca2+-induced GLUT4 and mitochondrial biogenesis. Since decreases in mitochondrial and GLUT4 contents are associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance, an understanding of the mechanisms by which these processes can be normalized will aid in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Many tumour cells have elevated rates of glucose uptake but reduced rates of oxidative phosphorylation. This persistence of high lactate production by tumours in the presence of oxygen, known as aerobic glycolysis, was first noted by Otto Warburg more than 75 yr ago. How tumour cells establish this altered metabolic phenotype and whether it is essential for tumorigenesis is as yet unknown. Here we show that a single switch in a splice isoform of the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase is necessary for the shift in cellular metabolism to aerobic glycolysis and that this promotes tumorigenesis. Tumour cells have been shown to express exclusively the embryonic M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase. Here we use short hairpin RNA to knockdown pyruvate kinase M2 expression in human cancer cell lines and replace it with pyruvate kinase M1. Switching pyruvate kinase expression to the M1 (adult) isoform leads to reversal of the Warburg effect, as judged by reduced lactate production and increased oxygen consumption, and this correlates with a reduced ability to form tumours in nude mouse xenografts. These results demonstrate that M2 expression is necessary for aerobic glycolysis and that this metabolic phenotype provides a selective growth advantage for tumour cells in vivo.},

abstract = {In this study we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with the carboxyl-cytoplasmic domain (residues 464-509) of the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 (C-GLUT4). Using as bait C-GLUT4, we have isolated the carboxyl domain of Daxx (C-Daxx), the adaptor protein associated with the Fas and the type II TGF-beta (TbetaRII) receptors (1,2 ). The two-hybrid interaction between C-GLUT4 and C-Daxx is validated by the ability of in vitro translated C-GLUT4 to interact with in vitro translated full-length Daxx and C-Daxx. C-Daxx does not interact with the C-cytoplasmic domain of GLUT1, the ubiquitous glucose transporter homologous to GLUT4. Replacement of alanine and serine for the dileucine pair (Leu(489)-Leu(490)) critical for targeting GLUT4 from the trans-Golgi network to the perinuclear intracellular store as well as for its surface internalization by endocytosis inhibits 2-fold the interaction of C-GLUT4 with Daxx. Daxx is pulled down with GLUT4 immunoprecipitated from lysates of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts stably transfected with GLUT4 and 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing physiological levels of the two proteins. Similarly, GLUT4 is recovered with anti-Daxx immunoprecipitates. Using an established cell fractionation procedure we present evidence for the existence of two distinct intracellular Daxx pools in the nucleus and low density microsomes. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies localize Daxx to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies and punctate cytoplasmic structures, often organized in strings and underneath the plasma membrane. Daxx and GLUT4 are SUMOlated as shown by their reaction with an anti-SUMO1 antibody and by the ability of this antibody to pull down Daxx and GLUT4.},

abstract = {The expression of five facilitative glucose transporter genes, GLUT1 (erythrocyte type), GLUT2 (liver type), GLUT3 (brain type), GLUT4 (muscle/fat type), and GLUT5 (small intestine type), was examined in human cancer tissues of the digestive system by RNA blotting analysis. The amounts of the GLUT1, GLUT2, and GLUT3 transcripts were elevated in most cancer tissues studied, although the expression of the GLUT2 gene is primarily restricted to the liver. On the other hand, mRNA levels of GLUT4 and GLUT5 were below sensitivity in all cancer tissues examined. These results suggest that over-expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 might be closely related with tissue development and that the acceleration of glucose uptake by transformed cells may result, at least in part, from the increase in the expression of these two glucose transporters.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor metabolism is a crucial factor for the carcinogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).

METHODS: Expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins (GLUT-1, HK 2, PFK-1, LDHA, TKTL1), mitochondrial enzymes (SDHA, SDHB, ATP synthase) were analyzed in normal oral mucosa (n = 5), oral precursor lesions (simple hyperplasia, n = 11; squamous intraepithelial neoplasia, SIN I-III, n = 35), and OSCC specimen (n = 42) by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis in OSCC cell lines. Metabolism-related proteins were correlated with proliferation activity (Ki-67) and apoptotic properties (TUNEL assay) in OSCC. Specificity of antibodies was confirmed by western blotting in cancer cell lines.

RESULTS: Expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins (GLUT-1, HK 2, LDHA, TKTL1), and mitochondrial enzymes (SDHA, SDHB, ATP synthase) were significantly increased in the carcinogenesis of OSCC. Metabolic active regions of OSCC were strongly correlated with proliferating cancer (Ki-67+) cells without detection of apoptosis (TUNEL assay).

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence of the expression of IGF-R1, glycolysis-related proteins GLUT-1, HK 2, PFK-1, LDHA, and TKTL1, as well as mitochondrial enzymes SDHA, SDHB, and ATP synthase in the multi-step carcinogenesis of OSCC. Both, hypoxia-related glucose metabolism and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation characteristics are associated with the carcinogenesis of OSCC. Acidosis and OXPHOS may drive a metabolic shift towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Therefore, inhibition of the PPP, glycolysis, and targeted anti-mitochondrial therapies (ROS generation) by natural compounds or synthetic vitamin derivatives may act as sensitizer for apoptosis in cancer cells mediated by adjuvant therapies in OSCC.},

abstract = {AIMS: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is associated with endothelial dysfunction and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether co-enzyme Q10 (CoQ) supplementation, which is an obligatory coenzyme in the mitochondrial respiratory transport chain, can reverse MD and improve endothelial function in patients with ischaemic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD).

METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the effects of CoQ supplement (300 mg/day, n=28) vs. placebo (controls, n=28) for 8 weeks on brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients with ischaemic LVSD(left ventricular ejection fraction {\textless}45{\%}). Mitochondrial function was determined by plasma lactate/pyruvate ratio (LP ratio). After 8 weeks, CoQ-treated patients had significant increases in plasma CoQ concentration (treatment effect 2.20 $\mu$g/mL, P{\textless}0.001) and FMD (treatment effect 1.51{\%}, P=0.03); and decrease in LP ratio (treatment effect -2.46, P=0.03) compared with controls. However, CoQ treatment did not alter nitroglycerin-mediated dilation, blood pressure, blood levels of fasting glucose, haemoglobin A1c, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and oxidative stress as determined by serum superoxide dismutase and 8-isoprostane (all P{\textgreater}0.05). Furthermore, the reduction in LP ratio significantly correlated with improvement in FMD (r=-0.29, P=0.047).

CONCLUSION: In patients with ischaemic LVSD, 8 weeks supplement of CoQ improved mitochondrial function and FMD; and the improvement of FMD correlated with the change in mitochondrial function, suggesting that CoQ improved endothelial function via reversal of mitochondrial dysfunction in patients with ischaemic LVSD.},

abstract = {In general, tumor cells display a more glycolytic phenotype compared to the corresponding normal tissue. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that tumors are composed of a heterogeneous population of cells. Breast cancers are organized in a hierarchical manner, with the breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) at the top of the hierarchy. Here, we investigate the metabolic phenotype of BCSCs and their differentiated progeny. In addition, we determine the effect of radiation on the metabolic state of these two cell populations. Luminal, basal, and claudin-low breast cancer cell lines were propagated as mammospheres enriched in BCSCs. Lactate production, glucose consumption, and ATP content were compared with differentiated cultures. A metabolic flux analyzer was used to determine the oxygen consumption, extracellular acidification rates, maximal mitochondria capacity, and mitochondrial proton leak. The effect of radiation treatment of the metabolic phenotype of each cell population was also determined. BCSCs consume more glucose, produce less lactate, and have higher ATP content compared to their differentiated progeny. BCSCs have higher maximum mitochondrial capacity and mitochondrial proton leak compared to their differentiated progeny. Radiation treatment enhances the higher energetic state of the BCSCs, while decreasing mitochondrial proton leak. Our study indicated that breast cancer cells are heterogeneous in their metabolic phenotypes and BCSCs reside in a distinct metabolic state compared to their differentiated progeny. BCSCs display a reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, while the more differentiated progeny displays a more glycolytic phenotype. Radiation treatment affects the metabolic state of BCSCs. We conclude that interfering with the metabolic requirements of BCSCs may prevent radiation-induced reprogramming of breast cancer cells during radiation therapy, thus improving treatment outcome.},

abstract = {Cell migration and invasion are critical parameters in the metastatic dissemination of cancer cells and the formation of metastasis, the major cause of death in cancer patients. Migratory cancer cells undergo dramatic molecular and cellular changes by remodeling their cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and their actin cytoskeleton, molecular processes that involve the activity of various signaling networks. Although in the past years, we have substantially expanded our knowledge on the cellular and molecular processes underlying cell migration and invasion in experimental systems, we still lack a clear understanding of how cancer cells disseminate in metastatic cancer patients. Different types of cancer cell migration seem to exist, including single-cell mesenchymal or amoeboid migration and collective cell migration. In most epithelial cancers, loss of the cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and gain of mesenchymal markers and promigratory signals underlie the conversion of epithelial, differentiated cells to mesenchymal, migratory, and invasive cells, a process referred to as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Although solitary migrating epithelial cancer cells have mostly undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (mesenchymal migration), and sometimes even lose their cell-matrix adhesion (amoeboid migration), collective migration of cancer cells in cell sheets, clusters, or streams is also frequently observed. The molecular mechanisms defining the different modes of cancer cell migration remain in most parts to be delineated.},

abstract = {The majority of research on reactive oxygen species (ROS) has focused on their cellular toxicities. Stem cells generally have been thought to maintain low levels of ROS as a protection against these processes. However, recent studies suggest that ROS can also play roles as second messengers, activating normal cellular processes. Here, we investigated ROS function in primary brain-derived neural progenitors. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that proliferative, self-renewing multipotent neural progenitors with the phenotypic characteristics of neural stem cells (NSC) maintained a high ROS status and were highly responsive to ROS stimulation. ROS-mediated enhancements in self-renewal and neurogenesis were dependent on PI3K/Akt signaling. Pharmacological or genetic manipulations that diminished cellular ROS levels also interfered with normal NSC and/or multipotent progenitor function both in vitro and in vivo. This study has identified a redox-mediated regulatory mechanism of NSC function that may have significant implications for brain injury, disease, and repair.},

abstract = {The insulin-regulated glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocates to the plasma membrane in response to insulin in order to facilitate the postprandial uptake of glucose into fat and muscle cells. While early insulin receptor signaling steps leading to this translocation are well defined, the integration of signaling and regulation of GLUT4 traffic remains elusive. Several lines of evidence suggest an important role for the actin cytoskeleton and for protein-protein interactions in regulating GLUT4 localization by insulin. Here, we applied stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) to identify proteins that interact with GLUT4 in an insulin-regulated manner. Myc-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc) stably expressed in L6 myotubes was immunoprecipitated via the myc epitope from total membranes isolated from basal and insulin-stimulated cells grown in medium containing normal isotopic abundance leucine or deuterated leucine, respectively. Proteins coprecipitating with GLUT4myc were analyzed by liquid chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry. Of 603 proteins quantified, 36 displayed an insulin-dependent change of their interaction with GLUT4myc of more than 1.5-fold in either direction. Several cytoskeleton-related proteins were elevated in immunoprecipates from insulin-treated cells, whereas components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system were generally reduced. Proteins participating in vesicle traffic also displayed insulin-regulated association. Of cytoskeleton-related proteins, alpha-actinin-4 recovery in GLUT4 immunoprecipitates rose in response to insulin 2.1 +/- 0.5-fold by SILAC and 2.9 +/- 0.8-fold by immunoblotting. Insulin caused GLUT4 and alpha-actinin-4 co-localization as revealed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. We conclude that insulin elicits changes in interactions between diverse proteins and GLUT4, and that cytoskeletal proteins, notably alpha-actinin-4, associate with the transporter, potentially to facilitate its routing to the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Current cancer therapies are based on the ability to inhibit the growth of rapidly dividing cells, the majority of which constitute the tumor. Although for decades, sporadic literature has posited the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), only recently has this type of cell been isolated and characterized from solid tumors. Like stem cells from their normal counterpart, CSCs are a rare population that can reconstitute a new tumor with similar composition and phenotype to the tumor of origin. These CSCs represent a small subset of the original tumor, grow indefinitely in vitro, and can form tumors in animals from a very few cells. The cells are slow cycling, capable of self-renewal and give rise to daughter cells that are either self-renewing and pluripotent or transit amplifying, and terminally differentiated. Thus far, CSCs have been isolated from only a small number of tumor types. In most instances, the cells are obtained using selection of, and enrichment for, cells with prospectively identified cell surface markers (Al-Hajj M, et al., 2003). This yields a very limited number of cells, and in many cases these cells cannot be cultured. There is a need for a method for isolation, purification, and expansion of stem cells from a greater spectrum of tumors. There is also evidence for "...a link between normal stem cell regulation and the control of cancer stem cells" (NCI Think Tanks in Cancer Biology, Executive Summary of the Tumor Stem Cell and Self-renewal Genes Think Tank1). We present here a strategy for the isolation and establishment of tumor cell lines that represent a minority of cells in the original tumor. They have the ability to grow indefinitely in vitro, form tumors in mice from less than 100 cells, and share many of the growth requirements and cell surface antigens of normal tissue stem cells from which they may arise.},

abstract = {The Warburg effect--a classical hallmark of cancer metabolism--is a counter-intuitive phenomenon in which rapidly proliferating cancer cells resort to inefficient ATP production via glycolysis leading to lactate secretion, instead of relying primarily on more efficient energy production through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, as most normal cells do. The causes for the Warburg effect have remained a subject of considerable controversy since its discovery over 80 years ago, with several competing hypotheses. Here, utilizing a genome-scale human metabolic network model accounting for stoichiometric and enzyme solvent capacity considerations, we show that the Warburg effect is a direct consequence of the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to increase biomass production rate. The analysis is shown to accurately capture a three phase metabolic behavior that is observed experimentally during oncogenic progression, as well as a prominent characteristic of cancer cells involving their preference for glutamine uptake over other amino acids.},

Three subgroups of MAPKs are involved in both cell growth and cell death, and the tight regulation of these pathways, therefore, is paramount in determining cell fate. MAPK pathways have been shown to be activated not only by receptor ligand interactions but also by different stressors placed on the cell. MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) dephosphorylate and deactivate MAPKs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide, have been reported to activate ERKs, JNKs, and p38 MAPKs, but the mechanisms by which ROS can activate these kinases are unclear. Oxidative modifications of MAPK signaling proteins and inactivation and/or degradation of MKPs may provide the plausible mechanisms for activation of MAPK pathways by ROS, which will be reviewed in this chapter.},

abstract = {A hypothesis that accounts for most of the available literature on insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation is that insulin action controls the access of GLUT4 vesicles to a constitutively active plasma-membrane fusion process. However, using an in vitro fusion assay, we show here that fusion is not constitutively active. Instead, the rate of fusion activity is stimulated 8-fold by insulin. Both the magnitude and time course of stimulated in vitro fusion recapitulate the cellular insulin response. Fusion is cell cytoplasm and SNARE dependent but does not require cell cytoskeleton. Furthermore, insulin activation of the plasma-membrane fraction of the fusion reaction is the essential step in regulation. Akt from the cytoplasm fraction is required for fusion. However, the participation of Akt in the stimulation of in vitro fusion is dependent on its in vitro recruitment onto the insulin-activated plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Most cells express facilitative glucose transporters. Four isoforms (GLUT1-4) transporting D-glucose across the plasma membrane show a specific tissue distribution, which is the basis for tissue-specific patterns in glucose metabolism. GLUT1 is expressed at high levels in tissue barriers such as the blood-brain barrier, and this isoform has been suggested as an indicator of such barriers. GLUT1 has been found in basal layers of human epidermis where no such tissue barrier is present. To further clarify these issues, we examined the distribution of GLUT1 and GLUT4 in skin, different types of oral mucosa from rat and man, and a human oral carcinoma by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. The results showed that GLUT1 was expressed in the basal and parabasal layers of the different stratified squamous epithelia, with some variations between keratinized and non-keratinized subtypes. GLUT1 was also expressed in ductal- and myoepithelial cells of minor salivary glands and perineural sheath located in the lamina propra, and furthermore in the cells of an oral carcinoma. GLUT4 was not expressed in any of the tissues examined. This distribution of GLUT1 does not fit with the idea of GLUT1 as a general indicator of tissue barriers. In contrast, our results support the prevailing, but limited knowledge of glucose metabolism in squamous stratified epithelia, a metabolism believed to depend mostly on glycolysis, especially in the basal layers. High-level expression seemed to be confined to keratinocytes without glycogen stores.},

abstract = {In myocytes and adipocytes, insulin increases glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) exocytosis by promoting GLUT4 vesicle docking/fusion with the membrane. Less is known about the mechanism and regulation of GLUT4 endocytosis, particularly in myocytes. Here, we show that GLUT4 internalization in L6 myoblasts was inhibited in part by hypertonicity or clathrin heavy chain knockdown and in part by cholesterol depletion. Both strategies had additive effects, abolishing GLUT4 endocytosis. GLUT4 internalization was abrogated by expressing dominant-negative dynamin-2 but unaffected by inhibiting caveolar-dependent endocytosis through syntaxin-6 knockdown or caveolin mutants (which reduced lactosylceramide endocytosis). Insulin did not affect GLUT4 internalization rate or sensitivity to clathrin or cholesterol depletion. In contrast, the mitochondrial uncoupler dinitrophenol (DNP), which like insulin increases surface GLUT4, reduced GLUT4 (but not transferrin) internalization, an effect additive to that of depleting clathrin but not cholesterol. Trout GLUT4 (a natural variant of GLUT4 bearing different endocytic motifs) exogenously expressed in mammalian L6 cells internalized only through the cholesterol-dependent route that also included the non-clathrin-dependent cargo interleukin-2 receptor beta, and DNP reduced internalization of both proteins. These results suggest that in muscle cells, GLUT4 internalizes simultaneously through clathrin-mediated endocytosis and a caveolae-independent but cholesterol- and dynamin-dependent route. Manipulating GLUT4 endocytosis to maintain surface GLUT4 may bypass insulin resistance.},

abstract = {The effects of 2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME)-induced apoptosis was examined in human leukemia cells (U937 and Jurkat) in relation to mitochondrial injury, oxidative damage, and perturbations in signaling pathways. 2ME induced apoptosis in these cells in a dose-dependent manner associated with release of mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, AIF), generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), downregulation of Mcl-1 and XIAP, and inactivation (dephosphorylation) of Akt accompanied by activation of JNK. In these cells, enforced activation of Akt by a constitutively active myristolated Akt construct prevented 2ME-mediated mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, JNK activation, and apoptosis, but not ROS generation. Conversely, 2ME lethality was potentiated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, in U937 cells, the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase and a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, TBAP, blocked these events, as well as Akt inactivation. Interruption of the JNK pathway by pharmacologic or genetic (e.g. siRNA) means attenuated 2ME-induced mitochondrial injury, XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, and apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest a hierarchical model of 2ME-related apoptosis induction in human leukemia cells in which 2ME-induced oxidative injury represents a primary event resulting in Akt inactivation, leading, in turn, to JNK activation, and culminating in XIAP and Mcl-1 downregulation, mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis. They also suggest that in human leukemia cells, the Akt pathway plays a critical role in mediating the response to oxidative stress induced by 2ME.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations are associated with various cancer types, suggesting that the mitochondrial genome may be a critical contributing factor in carcinogenesis. mtDNA alterations have been suggested as a potentially sensitive and specific biomarker for several cancer types. We examined mtDNA content in 25 pairs of normal and tumor breast tissue samples, 37 papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), 21 benign thyroid neoplasms and in 20 paired normal and PTC samples. Our results showed that mtDNA content was reduced in 80{\%} of the breast tumors relative to their corresponding normal. mtDNA was increased in papillary thyroid carcinomas, however, when compared to the corresponding normal DNA taken from the same individual. Also, mtDNA content was increased in none-paired PTC samples compared to the normal controls. Our findings indicate that changes in mtDNA content during carcinogenesis may be regulated in a tumor specific manner. Additionally, changes in mtDNA levels did not correlate with tumor grade and metastasis, suggesting that these alterations may occur in the early stages of tumorigenesis. Our findings suggest that mtDNA content can be used as a molecular diagnostic tool to help identify genetic abnormalities in human tumors.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) direct the activation of distinct signaling pathways that determine cell fate. In this study, the pathways activated and the mechanisms by which ROS and RNS control the viability of pancreatic $\beta$-cells were examined. Although both nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) induce DNA damage, reduce cell viability, and activate AMPK, the mechanisms of AMPK activation and cell death induction differ between each reactive species. Nitric oxide activates the unfolded protein and heat shock responses and MAPK kinase signaling, whereas H₂O₂ stimulates p53 stabilization and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activation but fails to induce the unfolded protein or heat shock responses or MAPK activation. The control of cell fate decisions is selective for the form of stress. H₂O₂-mediated reduction in $\beta$-cell viability is controlled by PARP, whereas cell death in response to nitric oxide is PARP independent but associated with the nuclear localization of GAPDH. These findings show that both ROS and RNS activate AMPK, induce DNA damage, and reduce cell viability; however, the pathways controlling the responses of $\beta$-cells are selective for the type of reactive species.},

abstract = {The pH of solid tumors is acidic due to increased fermentative metabolism and poor perfusion. It has been hypothesized that acid pH promotes local invasive growth and metastasis. The hypothesis that acid mediates invasion proposes that H(+) diffuses from the proximal tumor microenvironment into adjacent normal tissues where it causes tissue remodeling that permits local invasion. In the current work, tumor invasion and peritumoral pH were monitored over time using intravital microscopy. In every case, the peritumoral pH was acidic and heterogeneous and the regions of highest tumor invasion corresponded to areas of lowest pH. Tumor invasion did not occur into regions with normal or near-normal extracellular pH. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that cells in the invasive edges expressed the glucose transporter-1 and the sodium-hydrogen exchanger-1, both of which were associated with peritumoral acidosis. In support of the functional importance of our findings, oral administration of sodium bicarbonate was sufficient to increase peritumoral pH and inhibit tumor growth and local invasion in a preclinical model, supporting the acid-mediated invasion hypothesis.

abstract = {Clostridium difficile toxin A induces acute colitis with neutrophil infiltration and up-regulation of numerous pro-inflammatory mediators, but the contribution of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction in this infection is unknown. We report here that toxin A induces expression of COX-2 and secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured NCM460 human colonocytes and in human intestinal xenografts. This induction was blocked by SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, which also decreased the phosphorylation of MSK-1, CREB/ATF-1, and COX-2 promoter activity following toxin A stimulation. Gel shift assays indicated that CREB/ATF-1 was the major proteins binding to the COX-2-CRE. Moreover, colonocytes exposed to toxin A produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated p38 MAPK, MSK-1, and CREB/ATF-1, leading to subsequent COX-2 induction and PGE2 secretion. In intact mice, blockage of p38 MAPK inhibited toxin A-mediated induction of COX-2 in enterocytes as well as lamina propria cells, and significantly blocked the toxin A-induced ileal secretion of fluid and PGE2. Furthermore, a selective COX-2 inhibitor also diminished toxin A-associated ileal fluid and PGE2 secretion. The main signaling pathway for toxin A induction of human COX-2 involves ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK, MSK-1, CREB, and ATF-1. Toxin A triggers ileal inflammation and secretion of fluid via COX-2 induction and release of PGE2.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632), in combination with fibroblast feeder cells, induces normal and tumor epithelial cells from many tissues to proliferate indefinitely in vitro, without transduction of exogenous viral or cellular genes. Primary prostate and mammary cells, for example, are reprogrammed toward a basaloid, stem-like phenotype and form well-organized prostaspheres and mammospheres in Matrigel. However, in contrast to the selection of rare stem-like cells, the described growth conditions can generate 2 × 10(6) cells in 5 to 6 days from needle biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. Continued cell proliferation is dependent on both feeder cells and Y-27632, and the conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic. This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures from human and rodent tumors. For example, CRCs established from human prostate adenocarcinoma displayed instability of chromosome 13, proliferated abnormally in Matrigel, and formed tumors in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. The ability to rapidly generate many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking. In addition, the CRC method allows for the genetic manipulation of epithelial cells ex vivo and their subsequent evaluation in vivo in the same host.},

This phenomenon, also central to adipocyte biology, has been the subject of intense and productive research for decades. We focus on muscle cell studies scrutinizing insulin signals and vesicle traffic in a spatiotemporal manner. Using the analogy of an integrated circuit to approach the intersection between signal transduction and vesicle mobilization, we identify signaling relays ("software") that engage structural/mechanical elements ("hardware") to enact the rapid mobilization and incorporation of GLUT4 into the cell surface. We emphasize how insulin signal transduction switches from tyrosine through lipid and serine phosphorylation down to activation of small G proteins of the Rab and Rho families, describe key negative regulation step of Rab GTPases through the GTPase-activating protein activity of the Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), and focus on the mechanical effectors engaged by Rabs 8A and 10 (the molecular motor myosin Va), and the Rho GTPase Rac1 (actin filament branching and severing through Arp2/3 and cofilin). Finally, we illustrate how actin filaments interact with myosin 1c and $\alpha$-Actinin4 to promote vesicle tethering as preamble to fusion with the membrane.},

abstract = {Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (IFIT2) is one of the most highly responsive interferon-stimulated genes, but its biological functions are poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to explore the underlying mechanisms by which depleting IFIT2 induces the migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Stable IFIT2-depleted cells underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and exhibited enhanced cell motility and invasiveness compared with control cells. Furthermore, our results indicated that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) was activated in IFIT2-depleted cells. Inhibition of aPKC using a specific myristoylated PKC$\zeta$ pseudosubstrate or aPKC-targeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished IFIT2 depletion-induced EMT, migration and invasion, indicating that the activation of aPKC has an essential role in regulating the cellular responses induced by IFIT2 depletion. Following tail-vein injection, IFIT2-depleted OSCC cells colonized not only the lungs but also the heart, head and neck, retroperitoneal, and peritoneal cavities; whereas control cells predominantly localized in the lungs. IFIT2 mRNA and protein expression was positively associated with E-cadherin expression in OSCC patient specimens. The loss of E-cadherin and IFIT2 expression was observed at the invasive front of OSCC tumors, suggesting that the loss of IFIT2 may induce EMT and lead to the metastasis of OSCCs. OSCC patients possessing reduced IFIT2-expression levels (IFIT2 {\textless}50{\%}) exhibited greater rates of distant metastasis and poor prognoses compared with OSCC patients who expressed greater levels of IFIT2 (IFIT2 ≥50{\%}). These results demonstrate that IFIT2 depletion activates the aPKC pathway and consequently induces EMT, cell migration and invasion. Most importantly, depleting IFIT2 may participate in OSCC tumor progression, particularly during metastasis. Taken together, our study demonstrates that IFIT2, a protein responsible for interferon stimulation, may prevent OSCC metastasis and serve as a valuable prognostic marker.},

RA exerts its biological functions primarily through binding to and activating nuclear RA receptors (RARs, which include the RAR$\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ isotypes RARA, RARB and RARC). Aberrant expression or impaired function of these nuclear receptors has been linked to diverse types of cancer. RARs are RA-dependent transcription factors and regulate gene expression through the recruitment of different co-regulators (co-activators and co-repressors). TRIM24 (formerly known as TIF1$\alpha$) was among the first co-regulators identified as interacting with RARs in a ligand-dependent fashion, and it was recently shown to function in mice as a potent liver-specific tumor suppressor by attenuating Rara-mediated transcription.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an aggressive and lethal malignancy. Publically available cell lines are mostly of lingual origin, or have not been carefully characterized. Detailed characterization of novel HNSCC cell lines is needed in order to provide researchers a concrete keystone on which to build their investigations.

METHODS: The USC-HN1 cell line was established from a primary maxillary HNSCC biopsy explant in tissue culture. The immortalized cells were then further characterized by heterotransplantation in Nude mice; immunohistochemical staining for relevant HNSCC biomarkers; flow cytometry for surface markers; cytogenetic karyotypic analysis; human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus screening; qRT-PCR for oncogene and cytokine analysis; investigation of activated, cleaved Notch1 levels; and detailed 35,000 gene microarray analysis.

RESULTS: Characterization experiments confirmed the human HNSCC origin of USC-HN1, including a phenotype similar to the original tumor. Viral screening revealed no HPV or EBV infection, while western blotting displayed significant upregulation of activated, cleaved Notch1.

CONCLUSIONS: USC-HN1, a novel immortalized cell line has been derived from a maxillary HNSCC. Characterization studies have shown that the cell line is of HNSCC origin and displays many of the same markers previously reported in the literature. USC-HN1 is available for public research and will further the investigation of HNSCC and the development of new therapeutic modalities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) functions within the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway as a critical modulator of cell survival. On the basis of promising preclinical data, the safety and tolerability of therapy with the mTOR inhibitor RAD001 in combination with radiation (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) was evaluated in this Phase I study.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: All patients received weekly oral RAD001 in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy, followed by RAD001 in combination with standard adjuvant temozolomide. RAD001 was dose escalated in cohorts of 6 patients. Dose-limiting toxicities were defined during RAD001 combination therapy with TMZ/RT.

RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled, with a median follow-up of 8.4 months. Combined therapy was well tolerated at all dose levels, with 1 patient on each dose level experiencing a dose-limiting toxicity: Grade 3 fatigue, Grade 4 hematologic toxicity, and Grade 4 liver dysfunction. Throughout therapy, there were no Grade 5 events, 3 patients experienced Grade 4 toxicities, and 6 patients had Grade 3 toxicities attributable to treatment. On the basis of these results, the recommended Phase II dosage currently being tested is RAD001 70 mg/week in combination with standard chemoradiotherapy. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography scans also were obtained at baseline and after the second RAD001 dose before the initiation of TMZ/RT; the change in FDG uptake between scans was calculated for each patient. Fourteen patients had stable metabolic disease, and 4 patients had a partial metabolic response.

CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 in combination with RT/TMZ and adjuvant TMZ was reasonably well tolerated. Changes in tumor metabolism can be detected by FDG positron emission tomography in a subset of patients within days of initiating RAD001 therapy.},

abstract = {Although endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) have been used to promote revascularization after peripheral or myocardial ischemia, excess amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are often involved in senescence and apoptosis of EPCs, thereby causing defective neovascularization and reduced or failed recovery. Here, we examined the cytoprotective effect of Ecklonia cava-derived antioxidant dieckol (DK) on oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in EPCs to improve EPC bioactivity for vessel repair. Although H2O2 (10 (- 3) M) increased the intracellular ROS level in EPCs, DK (10ug/ml) pretreatment suppressed the H2O2-induced ROS increase and drastically reduced the ratios of apoptotic cells. H2O2-induced ROS increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and JNK; this was inhibited by DK pretreatment. H2O2 treatment increased the phosphorylation of NF-$\kappa$B, which was blocked by pretreatment with SB 203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, or SP 600125, a JNK inhibitor. H2O2 decreased the cellular levels of Bcl-2 and c-IAPs, cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins, but increased caspase-3 activation. However, all these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with DK. Injection of DK-mixed EPCs (DK + EPCs) into myocardial ischemic sites in vivo induced cellular proliferation and survival of cells at the ischemic sites and, thereby, enhanced the secretion of angiogenic cytokines at the ischemic sites. These results show that DK + EPC exhibit markedly enhanced anti-apoptotic and antioxidative capabilities, unlike that shown by EPCs alone; thus, they contribute to improved repair of ischemic myocardial injury through cell survival and angiogenic cytokine production.},

abstract = {Multiple myeloma is one of numerous malignancies characterized by increased glucose consumption, a phenomenon with significant prognostic implications in this disease. Few studies have focused on elucidating the molecular underpinnings of glucose transporter (GLUT) activation in cancer, knowledge that could facilitate identification of promising therapeutic targets. To address this issue, we performed gene expression profiling studies involving myeloma cell lines and primary cells as well as normal lymphocytes to uncover deregulated GLUT family members in myeloma. Our data demonstrate that myeloma cells exhibit reliance on constitutively cell surface-localized GLUT4 for basal glucose consumption, maintenance of Mcl-1 expression, growth, and survival. We also establish that the activities of the enigmatic transporters GLUT8 and GLUT11 are required for proliferation and viability in myeloma, albeit because of functionalities probably distinct from whole-cell glucose supply. As proof of principle regarding the therapeutic potential of GLUT-targeted compounds, we include evidence of the antimyeloma effects elicited against both cell lines and primary cells by the FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir, which exerts a selective off-target inhibitory effect on GLUT4. Our work reveals critical roles for novel GLUT family members and highlights a therapeutic strategy entailing selective GLUT inhibition to specifically target aberrant glucose metabolism in cancer.},

abstract = {Regularly performed aerobic exercise leads to increases in skeletal muscle mitochondria and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) protein content, resulting in an enhanced capacity to oxidize substrates and improvements in insulin- and contraction-mediated glucose uptake. Although the specific mechanisms governing these adaptive responses have not been fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that the increase in cytosolic Ca2+ that occurs with each wave of sacrolemmal depolarization is a key component of these processes. Treating L6 muscle cells with agents that increase Ca2+ without causing reductions in {\~{}}P or the activation of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase leads to increases in GLUT4 and mitochondrial protein contents. This effect is likely controlled through calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), since KN93, a specific CaMK inhibitor, blocks these adaptive responses. Recent findings provide evidence that the activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in the pathway through which Ca2+/CaMK mediates mitochondrial and GLUT4 biogenesis. p38 MAPK initiates GLUT4 and mitochondrial biogenesis through the activation of transcription factors and transcriptional coactivators such as myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1 alpha). Subsequent increases in the content of these proteins further enhance Ca2+-induced GLUT4 and mitochondrial biogenesis. Since decreases in mitochondrial and GLUT4 contents are associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance, an understanding of the mechanisms by which these processes can be normalized will aid in the prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {The current arsenal of tools and methods for the continuous monitoring and imaging of redox metabolic pathways in the context of intact cells is limited. Fluorogenic substrates allow for direct measurement of enzyme activity in situ; however, in contrast to proteases and exo-glycosidases, there are no simple guidelines for the design of selective probes for redox metabolic enzymes. Here, we introduce redox probe 1 and demonstrate its high selectivity in living cells for human hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. AKR1C isoforms perform multiple functions among which the metabolism of potent steroid hormones is well documented. Moreover, expression of these enzymes is responsive to cellular stress and pathogenesis, including cancer. Our probe design is based on redox-sensitive optical switches, which couple a ketone-alcohol redox event to a profound change in fluorescence. The high selectivity of phenyl ketone 1 for AKR1C2 over the many endogenous reductases present in mammalian cells was established by a quantitative comparison of the metabolic rates between null control cells (COS-1) and AKR1C2-transfected cells. Phenyl ketone 1 is a cell-permeable fluorogenic probe that permits a direct, real-time, and operationally simple readout of AKR1C2 enzyme activity in intact mammalian cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that probe 1 enables the quantitative examination of physiological substrate 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone ("dark substrate") in situ by means of a two-substrate competitive assay. Similarly, inhibitor potency of physiological (ursodeoxycholate) and synthetic inhibitors (flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, and naproxen) was also readily evaluated.},

abstract = {The GLUT4 glucose transporter is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle, heart and adipose tissue, where its expression is postnatal, coincident with the acquisition of insulin-regulated glucose transport. In muscle, contraction also regulates GLUT4 activity in the postnatal animal. Here we demonstrate that GLUT4 is expressed in the developing mouse embryo with specific tissue and spatiotemporal patterns. From embryonic day 9 (E9; E1 = day of copulation plug) to postnatal day 70 (P70), mice were analyzed for GLUT4 mRNA and protein expression by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. Specificity was confirmed with sense riboprobe hybridization and peptide competition, respectively. At E9, GLUT4 was detected in the cranial neural folds in the outer (mantle) layer of the neuroepithelium. At E10, expression was present throughout the developing heart and was prominent in the endocardial cushions through E12. At E10-12, GLUT4 was also prominent in craniofacial mesenchyme. GLUT4 expression in cartilage and bone was evident at E12 and was maintained throughout early postnatal life. GLUT4 was apparent throughout embryonic development in the ventricular epithelium, choroid plexus and in the developing cerebellum. At birth, cardiac expression was reduced and GLUT4 was most evident in cartilage, bone and specific brain regions. In the latter, GLUT4 expression was most evident in the cerebellum, specifically in the external granular layer through P7 and in the internal granular layer thereafter. Maximal GLUT4 protein levels in the cerebellum were measured between P14 and P21 and were reduced in the adult brain. These findings suggest that GLUT4-mediated glucose transport may play important roles during development of the brain and nonneuronal tissues in the mouse embryo.},

abstract = {Timely, and sometimes rapid, metabolic adaptation to changes in food supply is critical for survival as an organism moves from the fasted to the fed state, and vice versa. These transitions necessitate major metabolic changes to maintain energy homeostasis as the source of blood glucose moves away from ingested carbohydrates, through hepatic glycogen stores, towards gluconeogenesis. The integration of hepatic glycogen regulation with extra-hepatic energetics is a key aspect of these adaptive mechanisms. Here we use computational modeling to explore hepatic glycogen regulation under fed and fasting conditions in the context of a whole-body model. The model was validated against previous experimental results concerning glycogen phosphorylase a (active) and glycogen synthase a dynamics. The model qualitatively reproduced physiological changes that occur during transition from the fed to the fasted state. Analysis of the model reveals a critical role for the inhibition of glycogen synthase phosphatase by glycogen phosphorylase a. This negative regulation leads to high levels of glycogen synthase activity during fasting conditions, which in turn increases substrate (futile) cycling, priming the system for a rapid response once an external source of glucose is restored. This work demonstrates that a mechanistic understanding of the design principles used by metabolic control circuits to maintain homeostasis can benefit from the incorporation of mathematical descriptions of these networks into "whole-body" contextual models that mimic in vivo conditions.},

Our data comprises 649 SNPs. Three hundred sixty SNPs are predicted to have biological consequences (functional SNPs). These SNPs can be directly used in further studies to test their association with risk, treatment response and prognosis in cancer. To systematically cover the EGFR pathway, we also performed a network-based analysis to further select putative functional SNPs from the genes whose protein products physically interact with the EGFR pathway proteins. We utilized protein-protein interaction information and focused on 14 proteins that have a high degree of connectivity (interacting with {\textgreater} or = 10 proteins) with the EGFR pathway genes identified to have functional SNPs (f-EGFR genes). Two of these proteins (FYN and LCK) had interactions with 17 of the f-EGFR genes, yet both lacked any putative functional SNP. However, our analysis indicated the presence of potentially functional SNPs in 9 other highly interactive proteins. The genes and their SNPs identified in the network-based analysis represent potential candidates for gene-gene and SNP-SNP interaction studies in cancer research.},

The potency and selectivity for subreactions of transcription reside in the coactivators, and thus, they are critically important for tissue-selective gene function. Each tissue has a "quantitative finger print" of coactivators based on its relative inherited concentrations of these molecules. When the cellular concentration of a coactivator is altered, genetic dysfunction usually leads to a pathologic outcome. For example, many cancers overexpress "growth coactivators." In this way, the cancer cell can hijack these coactivator molecules to drive proliferation and metastasis.

abstract = {Administration of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has the potential to ameliorate degenerative disorders and to repair damaged tissues. The homing of transplanted MSCs to injured sites is a critical property of engraftment. Our aim was to identify microRNAs involved in controlling MSC proliferation and migration. MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow and umbilical cord Wharton's jelly (BM-MSCs and WJ-MSCs, respectively), and WJ-MSCs show poorer motility yet have a better amplification rate compared with BM-MSCs. Small RNA sequencing revealed that miR-146a-5p is significantly overexpressed and has high abundance in WJ-MSCs. Knockdown of miR-146a-5p in WJ-MSCs inhibited their proliferation yet enhanced their migration, whereas overexpression of miR-146a-5p in BM-MSCs did not influence their osteogenic and adipogenic potentials. Chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (CXCL12), together with SIKE1, which is an I-kappa-B kinase epsilon (IKK$\epsilon$) suppressor, is a direct target of miR-146a-5p in MSCs. Knockdown of miR-146a-5p resulted in the down-regulation of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-$\kappa$B) activity, which is highly activated in WJ-MSCs and is known to activate miR-146a-5p promoter. miR-146a-5p is also downstream of CXCL12, and a negative feedback loop is therefore formed in MSCs. These findings suggest that miR-146a-5p is critical to the uncoupling of motility and proliferation of MSCs. Our miRNome data also provide a roadmap for further understanding MSC biology.},

abstract = {GLUT1 is the predominant glucose transporter in leukemia cells, and the modulation of glucose transport activity by cytokines, oncogenes or metabolic stresses is essential for their survival and proliferation. However, the molecular mechanisms allowing to control GLUT1 trafficking and degradation are still under debate. In this study we investigated whether plasma membrane cholesterol depletion plays a role in glucose transport activity in M07e cells, a human megakaryocytic leukemia line. To this purpose, the effect of cholesterol depletion by methyl-$\beta$-cyclodextrin (MBCD) on both GLUT1 activity and trafficking was compared to that of the cytokine Stem Cell Factor (SCF). Results show that, like SCF, MBCD led to an increased glucose transport rate and caused a subcellular redistribution of GLUT1, recruiting intracellular transporter molecules to the plasma membrane. Due to the role of caveolae/lipid rafts in GLUT1 stimulation in response to many stimuli, we have also investigated the GLUT1 distribution along the fractions obtained after non ionic detergent treatment and density gradient centrifugation, which was only slightly changed upon MBCD treatment. The data suggest that MBCD exerts its action via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism that ultimately results in augmented GLUT1 translocation. Moreover, cholesterol depletion triggers GLUT1 translocation without the involvement of c-kit signalling pathway, in fact MBCD effect does not involve Akt and PLC$\gamma$ phosphorylation. These data, together with the observation that the combined MBCD/SCF cell treatment caused an additive effect on glucose uptake, suggest that the action of SCF and MBCD may proceed through two distinct mechanisms, the former following a signalling pathway, and the latter possibly involving a novel cholesterol dependent mechanism.},

Since then, it has become clear that multiple oncogenic events contribute to the development of a metabolic phenotype that supports rapid proliferation. Because this phenotype represents an essential component of tumorigenesis and disease progression, it also represents a potential source of biomarkers associated with aggressive disease. In addition, the addiction of tumor cells to specific nutrients and the up-regulation of key metabolic enzymes provide unique opportunities for pharmacologic manipulation. Despite the use of multimodality treatment, survival rates for patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain low, partially attributed to the development of drug resistance. In this review, we evaluate the role of altered HNSCC metabolism as both a source of novel biomarkers and a means to bypass resistance mechanisms to conventional forms of therapy.},

abstract = {Restricting the intake of calories has been practiced as a method for increasing both the length and quality of life for over 500 years. Experimental work confirming the success of this approach in animals has accumulated over the last 100 years. Lifelong caloric restriction (CR) may extend life by up to 50{\%} in rodents, with progressively less impact the later in life it is started. This effect is matched by profound impacts on age related diseases including reduced risk of cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disease, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus. The disposable soma theory of ageing suggests that CR evolved as a somatic protection response to enable animals to survive periods of food shortage. The shutdown of reproductive function during CR is consistent with this suggestion, but other features of the phenomenon are less consistent with this theory, and some have suggested that in rodents it may be mostly an artifact of domestication. CR induces profound effects on animals at all levels from the transcriptome to whole animal physiology and behavior. Animals under CR lose weight which is disproportionately contributed to by white adipose tissue. Generally animals on CR change their activity patterns so that they are more active prior to food delivery each day but total activity may be unchanged or reduced. Considerable debate has occurred over the effects of CR on resting metabolic rate (RMR). Total RMR declines, but as body mass and body composition also change it is unclear whether metabolism at the tissue level also declines, is unchanged or even increases. Body temperature universally decreases. Hunger is increased and does not seem to abate even with very long term restriction. Circulating adipokines are reduced reflecting the reduction in white adipose tissue (WAT) mass under restriction and there is a large reduction in circulating insulin and glucose levels. There are profound tissue level changes in metabolism with a generalized shift from carbohydrate to fat metabolism. Four pathways have been implicated in mediating the CR effect. These are the insulin like growth factor (IGF-1)/insulin signaling pathway, the sirtuin pathway, the adenosine monophosphate (AMP) activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway and the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. These different pathways may interact and may all play important roles mediating different aspects of the response. Exactly how they generate the health benefits remains open for debate, however CR results in reduced oxidative stress and enhanced autophagy, both of which could be essential components of the beneficial effects. Most data about the effects of CR in mammals comes from work on rodents. There is limited work on non-human primates that shows promising effects and one randomized controlled trial in humans where physiological markers of the CR response are consistent with the responses in mice and rats. There are also populations of humans voluntarily restricting themselves. Humans on long term restriction report similar negative side effects to those observed in animals - perpetual hunger, reduced body temperature leading to a feeling of being cold, and diminished libido. Considerable effort has been directed in recent years to find drugs that mimic the CR response. Promising candidates are those that intersect with the critical signaling pathways identified above and include biguanides such as metformin that target the insulin signaling pathway, stilbenes (e.g. resveratrol) that affect sirtuin activity and drugs such as rapamycin that interact with mTOR signaling. Whether it will ever be possible to find drugs that capture the health benefits of CR without the negative side-effects remains unclear. Moreover, even if such drugs are developed how the current licensing system for drug use in western societies would cope with them may be a further obstacle to their use.},

abstract = {Although Fas ligand (FasL) is primarily expressed by lymphoid cells, its receptor Fas (CD95/Apo-1) is broadly expressed in numerous nonlymphoid tissues and can mediate apoptosis of parenchymal cells upon injury and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Here we show that CCN1 (CYR61) and CCN2 (CTGF), matricellular proteins upregulated at sites of inflammation and wound repair, synergize with FasL to induce apoptosis by elevating cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). CCN1 acts through engagement of integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, leading to ROS-dependent hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in the presence of FasL to enhance mitochondrial cytochrome c release. We show that CCN1 activates neutral sphingomyelinase, which functions as a key source of CCN1-induced ROS critical for synergism with FasL. Furthermore, Fas-dependent hepatic apoptosis induced by an agonistic monoclonal anti-Fas antibody or intragastric administration of alcohol is severely blunted in knock-in mice expressing an apoptosis-defective Ccn1 allele. These results demonstrate that CCN1 is a physiologic regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and that the extracellular matrix microenvironment can modulate Fas-dependent apoptosis through CCN1 expression. Cell adhesion to several abundant extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins via engagement of integrin receptors is known to induce potent prosurvival signals, whereas detachment from the ECM triggers many cell types to undergo anoikis, a form of apoptotic cell death (13). This regulation of cell survival through integrin-mediated cell adhesion plays a critical role in controlling homeostasis and the integrity of tissue architecture, whereas unligated or inappropriately ligated integrins may elicit apoptotic signals (12). However, during embryogenesis, inflammation, tissue remodeling, and wound repair, death-inducing factors can provoke programmed or apoptotic death in normal cells without requiring their detachment from the ECM (4). Fas (CD95/APO-1) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family of cell surface death receptors that mediates apoptotic signals upon binding to its specific ligand, FasL. Ligation of Fas to FasL or its agonistic antibodies results in receptor clustering, recruitment of the adaptor protein FADD, and activation of the proteolytic caspase cascade (19, 50). Whereas FasL is primarily expressed in activated T lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and tissues of immune privilege, Fas is broadly expressed in most lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues (50). Fas-mediated apoptosis is critical for the regulation of the immune response, including deletion of activated T and B lymphocytes, cell death-inducing activity of cytotoxic T cells, and removal of infiltrating lymphocytes in immune-privileged tissues (19, 50). Fas also plays an important role in parenchymal cell apoptosis in many organs during tissue injury and upon inflammatory infiltration of lymphocytes (7, 20, 38, 42, 46). Consistent with the notion that cell adhesion promotes cell survival, integrin-matrix interactions inhibit Fas-dependent apoptosis in a variety of cell types (22, 32). Thus, optimal apoptotic responses to Fas/FasL signaling in adherent parenchymal cells must override the cytoprotective effects of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. In these instances, dynamic changes in the ECM induced by inflammation or injury repair may establish conditions that are permissive of, or conducive to, the apoptotic responses to FasL. Recent studies have described the emergence of ECM proteins that can induce or promote apoptosis (49, 60, 65). Among them are members of the CCN family (9), which are secreted cysteine-rich proteins that serve regulatory rather than structural roles in the ECM and are therefore considered matricellular proteins (6). CCN1 (CYR61) and CCN2 (CTGF) support cell adhesion, stimulate cell migration, induce angiogenesis, and promote chondrogenic differentiation, exerting their functions primarily through direct binding to integrin receptors. CCN1 and CCN2 promote the survival of endothelial cells through integrin $\alpha$v$\beta$3 but induce apoptosis in p21-deficient fibroblasts through $\alpha$6$\beta$1 via a caspase-8-independent mechanism (3, 40, 60). CCN1 and CCN2 are also critical for embryonic development, as Ccn1-null mice die during midgestation due to cardiovascular abnormalities and Ccn2-deficient mice perish perinatally as a consequence of severe skeletal malformations (29, 47, 48). In the adult, CCN proteins are highly expressed at sites of inflammation, injury repair, and tissue remodeling and are implicated in diseases where inflammation plays a role, including fibrosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and cancer (9). Furthermore, the presence of CCN1 in the ECM enables TNF-$\alpha$ to induce apoptotic death in normal cells without inhibition of NF-$\kappa$B signaling or de novo protein synthesis, conditions thought to be necessary for TNF-$\alpha$ to be cytotoxic (10). Here we show that CCN1 and CCN2 can synergize with FasL and significantly enhance FasL-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. Mechanistically, CCN1 engages integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), leading to the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the presence of FasL, which greatly enhances mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosis. We show that CCN1 is a novel activator of neutral sphingomyelinase (nSMase), which is an essential contributor to CCN1-induced ROS. Further, Fas-dependent hepatic cell death is greatly diminished in knock-in mice expressing an apoptosis-defective mutant of CCN1 that is unable to bind $\alpha$6$\beta$1-HSPGs. Together, these results show that CCN1 is a physiologic regulator of Fas-mediated apoptosis and indicate that Fas-dependent cell death at sites of inflammation and injury repair may be controlled by the matrix microenvironment through CCN1 expression.},

Although different models have been proposed, there is still no clear picture of how these three components cooperate to initiate endocytosis, which may indicate that there is some flexibility underlying this important event.},

abstract = {The enzyme fumarase is a conserved protein in all organisms with regard to its sequence, structure and function. This enzyme participates in the tricarboxylic acid cycle in mitochondria which is essential for cellular respiration in eukaryotes. However, a common theme conserved from yeast to humans is the existence of a cytosolic form of fumarase; hence this protein is dual localized. We have coined identical (or nearly identical) proteins situated in different subcellular locations 'echoforms' or 'echoproteins'. Fumarase was the first example of a dual localized protein whose mechanism of distribution was found to be based on a single translation product. Consequently, fumarase has become a paradigm for three unique eukaryotic cellular phenomena related to protein dual localization: (a) distribution between mitochondria and the cytoplasm involves reverse translocation; (b) targeting to mitochondria involves translation coupled import; and (c) there are two echoforms possessing distinct functions in the respective subcellular compartments. Here we describe and discuss these fumarase related phenomena and in addition point out approaches for studying dual function of distributed proteins, in particular compartment-specific depletion. In the case of fumarase, the cytoplasmic function was only recently discovered; the enzyme was found to participate in the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. Strikingly, upon DNA damage the protein is transported from the cytosol to the nucleus, where by virtue of its enzymatic activity it participates in the DNA damage response.},

Due to the ubiquitousness of these transporters, their differential expression is involved in various disease states such as diabetes, ischemia and cancer. The majority of cancers and isolated cancer cell lines over-express the GLUT family members which are present in the respective tissue of origin under non-cancerous conditions. Moreover, due to the requirement of energy to feed uncontrolled proliferation, cancer cells often express GLUTs which under normal conditions would not be present in these tissues. This over-expression is predominantly associated with the likelihood of metastasis and hence poor patient prognosis. This article presents a review of the current literature on the regulation and expression of GLUT family members and has compiled clinical and research data on GLUT expression in human cancers and in isolated human cancer cell lines.},

abstract = {Multivariable prognostic models are widely used in cancer and other disease areas, and have a range of applications in clinical medicine, clinical trials and allocation of health services resources. A well-founded and reliable measure of the prognostic ability of a model would be valuable to help define the separation between patients or prognostic groups that the model could provide, and to act as a benchmark of model performance in a validation setting. We propose such a measure for models of survival data. Its motivation derives originally from the idea of separation between Kaplan-Meier curves. We define the criteria for a successful measure and discuss them with respect to our approach. Adjustments for 'optimism', the tendency for a model to predict better on the data on which it was derived than on new data, are suggested. We study the properties of the measure by simulation and by example in three substantial data sets. We believe that our new measure will prove useful as a tool to evaluate the separation available-with a prognostic model.},

abstract = {Caffeine inhibits insulin-induced glucose uptake in rat adipocytes and also decreases insulin sensitivity, including whole-body glucose disposal and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle, during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp in human. However, the mechanism by which caffeine decreases the insulin sensitivity is not still clear. We found that pre-treatment with caffeine inhibited the insulin-induced 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H]glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner in mouse preadipose MC-3T3-G2/PA6 cells differentiated into mature adipose cells. Caffeine also suppressed insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation in the differentiated cells. Although caffeine did not alter insulin-induced activation of PI3K and protein kinase C-zeta (PKCzeta), an isoform of atypical PKC, which is reported to have an important role in insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation, we found that insulin-induced phosphorylation and activation of Akt were blocked by pre-treatment with caffeine. Inhibition of insulin-induced 2-deoxy-D-[1-(3)H]glucose uptake by caffeine was also observed in primary cultured brown adipocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. These results may, in part, explain the ability of caffeine to decrease insulin sensitivity.},

abstract = {Murine double minute (MDM2) binding protein (MTBP) has been implicated in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate one mechanism by which MTBP inhibits cancer metastasis. Overexpression of MTBP in human osteosarcoma cell lines lacking wild-type p53 did not alter primary tumor growth in mice, but significantly inhibited metastases. MTBP downregulation increased the migratory potential of MDM2(-/-)p53(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, suggesting that MTBP inhibited cell migration independently of the Mdm2-p53 pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometric analysis identified alpha-actinin-4 (ACTN4) as an MTBP-interacting protein. Endogenous MTBP interacted with and partially colocalized with ACTN4. MTBP overexpression inhibited cell migration and filopodia formation mediated by ACTN4. Increased cell migration by MTBP downregulation was inhibited by concomitant downregulation of ACTN4. MTBP also inhibited ACTN4-mediated F-actin bundling. We furthermore demonstrated that nuclear localization of MTBP was dispensable for inhibiting ACTN4-mediated cell migration and filopodia formation. Thus, MTBP suppresses cell migration, at least partially, by inhibiting ACTN4 function. Our study not only provides a mechanism of metastasis suppression by MTBP, but also suggests MTBP as a potential biomarker for cancer progression.},

TRIM24 interacts with the liganded retinoic acid (RA) receptor to repress its transcriptional activity. Germ line inactivation of TRIM24 in mice deregulates RA-signaling in hepatocytes leading to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we show that TRIM24 can be purified as at least two macromolecular complexes comprising either TRIM33 or TRIM33 and TRIM28. Somatic hepatocyte-specific inactivation of TRIM24, TRIM28, or TRIM33 all promote HCC in a cell-autonomous manner in mice. Moreover, HCC formation upon TRIM24 inactivation is strongly potentiated by further loss of TRIM33. These results demonstrate that the TIF1-related subfamily of TRIM proteins interact both physically and functionally to modulate HCC formation in mice.},

abstract = {Metabolic activities in normal cells rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to generate ATP for energy. Unlike in normal cells, glycolysis is enhanced and OXPHOS capacity is reduced in various cancer cells. It has long been believed that the glycolytic phenotype in cancer is due to a permanent impairment of mitochondrial OXPHOS, as proposed by Otto Warburg. This view is challenged by recent investigations which find that the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS in most cancers is intact. Aerobic glycolysis in many cancers is the combined result of various factors such as oncogenes, tumor suppressors, a hypoxic microenvironment, mtDNA mutations, genetic background and others. Understanding the features and complexity of the cancer energy metabolism will help to develop new approaches in early diagnosis and effectively target therapy of cancer.},

@article{Lu2014,
abstract = {Compared to normal cells, cancer cells strongly upregulate glucose uptake and glycolysis to give rise to increased yield of intermediate glycolytic metabolites and the end product pyruvate. Moreover, glycolysis is uncoupled from the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer cells. Consequently, the majority of glycolysis-derived pyruvate is diverted to lactate fermentation and kept away from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. This metabolic phenotype is known as the Warburg effect. While it has become widely accepted that the glycolytic intermediates provide essential anabolic support for cell proliferation and tumor growth, it remains largely elusive whether and how the Warburg metabolic phenotype may play a role in tumor progression. We hereby review the cause and consequence of the restrained oxidative metabolism, in particular in the context of tumor metastasis. Cells change or lose their extracellular matrix during the metastatic process. Inadequate/inappropriate matrix attachment generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and causes a specific type of cell death, termed anoikis, in normal cells. Although anoikis is a barrier to metastasis, cancer cells have often acquired elevated threshold for anoikis and hence heightened metastatic potential. As ROS are inherent byproducts of oxidative metabolism, forced stimulation of glucose oxidation in cancer cells raises oxidative stress and restores cells' sensitivity to anoikis. Therefore, by limiting the pyruvate flux into mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, the Warburg effect enables cancer cells to avoid excess ROS generation from mitochondrial respiration and thus gain increased anoikis resistance and survival advantage for metastasis. Consistent with this notion, pro-metastatic transcription factors HIF and Snail attenuate oxidative metabolism, whereas tumor suppressor p53 and metastasis suppressor KISS1 promote mitochondrial oxidation. Collectively, these findings reveal mitochondrial oxidative metabolism as a critical suppressor of metastasis and justify metabolic therapies for potential prevention/intervention of tumor metastasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Blue light is part of the visible light spectrum that does not generate harmful DNA adducts associated with skin cancer and photoaging, and may represent a safer therapeutic modality for treatment of keloid scars and other fibrotic skin diseases. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that light-emitting diode (LED) red and infrared light inhibits proliferation of skin fibroblasts. Moreover, different wavelengths of light can produce different biological effects. Furthermore, the effects of LED blue light (LED-BL) on human skin fibroblasts are not well characterized. This study investigated the effects of LED-BL on human skin fibroblast proliferation, viability, migration speed, and reactive oxygen-species (ROS) generation. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Irradiation of adult human skin fibroblasts using commercially-available LED-BL panels was performed in vitro, and modulation of proliferation and viability was quantified using the trypan blue dye exclusion assay, migratory speed was assessed using time-lapse video microscopy, and intracellular ROS generation was measured using the dihydrorhodamine flow cytometry assay. Statistical differences between groups were determined by ANOVA and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Human skin fibroblasts treated with LED-BL fluences of 5, 10, 15, 30, and 80 J/cm(2) demonstrated statistically significant dose-dependent decreases in relative proliferation of 8.4{\%}, 29.1{\%}, 33.8{\%}, 51.7{\%}, and 55.1{\%}, respectively, compared to temperature and environment matched bench control plates, respectively. LED-BL fluences of 5, 30, 45, and 80 J/cm(2) decreased fibroblast migration speed to 95 ± 7.0{\%} (P = 0.64), 81.3 ± 5.5{\%} (P = 0.021), 48.5 ± 2.7{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001), and 32.3 ± 1.9{\%} (P {\textless} 0.0001), respectively, relative to matched controls. LED fluences of 5, 10, 30, and 80 J/cm(2) resulted in statistically significant increases in reactive oxygen species of 110.4{\%}, 116.6{\%}, 127.5{\%}, and 130{\%}, respectively, relative to bench controls. CONCLUSION: At the fluences studied, LED-BL can inhibit adult human skin dermal fibroblast proliferation and migration speed, and is associated with increased reactive oxygen species generation in a dose-dependent manner without altering viability. LED-BL has the potential to contribute to the treatment of keloids and other fibrotic skin diseases and is worthy of further translational and clinical investigation. Lasers Surg.

Accelerated atherosclerotic lesions were established by administration of a high-fat diet in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice. Lentiviral overexpression of meprin$\alpha$ in the thoracic aortic artery during plaque formation enhanced intra-plaque macrophage induction of ROS as well as formation of atherosclerotic plaques, whereas AG1478 (specific inhibitor of the EGFR) treatment exerted the opposite effect. A meprin$\alpha$ inhibitor abrogated EGFR activation in mice. In cultured J774a.1 macrophages, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL) increased ROS formation and EGFR activation through a ligand [heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF)]-dependent pathway. However, a meprin$\alpha$ inhibitor or specific siRNA inhibited ROS production and EGFR activation. Recombinant mouse meprin$\alpha$ enhanced OxLDL-stimulated production of ROS and induced HB-EGF. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase by SB203580 decreased OxLDL-stimulated production of ROS. Conversely, inhibition of meprin$\alpha$ or PI3K-Rac1 inhibitors also decreased p38 activity in OxLDL-stimulated macrophages. In addition, inhibition of meprin$\alpha$ reversed OxLDL-stimulated activation of PI3K. Meprin$\alpha$ promotes OxLDL-induced plaque formation and ROS release by transactivation of the EGFR, followed by activation of the PI3K/Rac1/p38 pathway.},

abstract = {The past years have seen increasing interest in nonlinear optical microscopic imaging approaches for the investigation of diseases due to the method's unique capabilities of deep tissue penetration, 3D sectioning and molecular contrast. Its application in clinical routine diagnostics, however, is hampered by large and costly equipment requiring trained staff and regular maintenance, hence it has not yet matured to a reliable tool for application in clinics. In this contribution implementing a novel compact fiber laser system into a tailored designed laser scanning microscope results in a small footprint easy to use multimodal imaging platform enabling simultaneously highly efficient generation and acquisition of second harmonic generation (SHG), two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) as well as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) signals with optimized CARS contrast for lipid imaging for label-free investigation of tissue samples. The instrument combining a laser source and a microscope features a unique combination of the highest NIR transmission and a fourfold enlarged field of view suited for investigating large tissue specimens. Despite its small size and turnkey operation rendering daily alignment dispensable the system provides the highest flexibility, an imaging speed of 1 megapixel per second and diffraction limited spatial resolution. This is illustrated by imaging samples of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and an animal model of atherosclerosis allowing for a complete characterization of the tissue composition and morphology, i.e. the tissue's morphochemistry. Highly valuable information for clinical diagnostics, e.g. monitoring the disease progression at the cellular level with molecular specificity, can be retrieved. Future combination with microscopic probes for in vivo imaging or even implementation in endoscopes will allow for in vivo grading of HNSCC and characterization of plaque deposits towards the detection of high risk plaques.},

abstract = {There is evidence that the atypical protein kinases C (PKC(lambda), PKC(zeta)) participate in signaling from the insulin receptor to cause the translocation of glucose transporters from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane in adipocytes. In order to search for downstream effectors of these PKCs, we identified the proteins that were immunoprecipitated by an antibody against PKC(lambda/zeta) from lysates of 3T3-L1 adipocytes through peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry. The data show that PKC(lambda) is the major atypical PKC in these cells. Moreover, an oligomeric complex consisting of alpha- and gamma-adducin, which are cytoskeletal proteins, coimmunoprecipitated with PKC(lambda). Association of the adducins with PKC(lambda) was further indicated by the finding that the adducins coimmunoprecipitated proportionally with PKC(lambda) in repeated rounds of immunoprecipitation. Such an association is consistent with literature reports that the adducins contain a single major site for PKC phosphorylation in their carboxy termini. Using antibody against the phospho form of this site for immunoblotting, we found that insulin caused little or no increase in the phosphorylation of this site on the adducins in a whole cell lysate or on the small portion of the adducins that coimmunoprecipitated with PKC(lambda). PKC(lambda) and the adducins were located in both the cytosol and subcellular membranous fractions. The binding of PKC(lambda) to adducin may function to localize PKC(lambda) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.},

abstract = {Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been reported in various cancers, including in skin squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC). The molecular mechanisms regulating tumour initiation and stemness are still poorly characterized. Here we find that Sox2, a transcription factor expressed in various types of embryonic and adult stem cells, was the most upregulated transcription factor in the CSCs of squamous skin tumours in mice. SOX2 is absent in normal epidermis but begins to be expressed in the vast majority of mouse and human pre-neoplastic skin tumours, and continues to be expressed in a heterogeneous manner in invasive mouse and human SCCs. In contrast to other SCCs, in which SOX2 is frequently genetically amplified, the expression of SOX2 in mouse and human skin SCCs is transcriptionally regulated. Conditional deletion of Sox2 in the mouse epidermis markedly decreases skin tumour formation after chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter of Sox2 transcriptional expression (SOX2-GFP knock-in mice), we showed that SOX2-expressing cells in invasive SCC are greatly enriched in tumour-propagating cells, which further increase upon serial transplantations. Lineage ablation of SOX2-expressing cells within primary benign and malignant SCCs leads to tumour regression, consistent with the critical role of SOX2-expressing cells in tumour maintenance. Conditional Sox2 deletion in pre-existing skin papilloma and SCC leads to tumour regression and decreases the ability of cancer cells to be propagated upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice, supporting the essential role of SOX2 in regulating CSC functions. Transcriptional profiling of SOX2-GFP-expressing CSCs and of tumour epithelial cells upon Sox2 deletion uncovered a gene network regulated by SOX2 in primary tumour cells in vivo. Chromatin immunoprecipitation identified several direct SOX2 target genes controlling tumour stemness, survival, proliferation, adhesion, invasion and paraneoplastic syndrome. We demonstrate that SOX2, by marking and regulating the functions of skin tumour-initiating cells and CSCs, establishes a continuum between tumour initiation and progression in primary skin tumours.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate in-vivo visible imaging of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with near-infrared quantum dots.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantum dots with an emission wavelength of 800 nm (QD800) were conjugated to monoclonal antibodies against EGFR, resulting in the probe designated as QD800-EGFR Ab. OSCC cell line (BcaCD885) expressing high levels of EGFR was transplanted subcutaneously into nude mice cheeks to develop an OSCC animal model. QD800-EGFR Ab containing 100 pmol equivalent of QD800 was intravenously injected into the animal model, and in-situ and in-vivo imaging of cheek squamous cell carcinoma was analyzed at 10 different time points.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In-vivo imaging and immunohistochemical examination of the tumors showed that intravenously injected QD800-EGFR Ab probe could bind EGFR expressed on BcaCD885 cells. Fluorescence signals of BcaCD885 cells labeled with QD800-EGFR Ab probe could be clearly detected, and these fluorescence signals lasted for 24 hours. The most complete tumor images with maximal signal-to-noise ratio were observed from 15 minutes to 6 hours after injection of the probe. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that has obtained clear in-situ and in-vivo imaging of head and neck cancer by using QD800-EGFR Ab probe. The authors conclude that the combination of near-infrared quantum dots that are highly penetrating for tissues with EGFR monoclonal antibody has promising prospects in in-vivo imaging of OSCC and development of personalized surgical therapies.},

Although such a metabolic rewiring has recently been indicated as yet another general hallmark of cancer, accumulating evidence suggests that the metabolic alterations of each neoplasm represent a molecular signature that intimately accompanies and allows for different facets of malignant transformation. During the past decade, targeting cancer metabolism has emerged as a promising strategy for the development of selective antineoplastic agents. Here, we discuss the intimate relationship between metabolism and malignancy, focusing on strategies through which this central aspect of tumour biology might be turned into cancer's Achilles heel.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, several reports have described the presence of F0F1 ATP synthase subunits at the surface of hepatocytes, where the hydrolytic activity of F1 sector faces outside and triggers HDL endocytosis. An intriguing question is whether the ectopic enzyme has same subunit composition and molecular mass as that of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Also due to the polar nature of hepatocytes, the enzyme may be localized to a particular cell boundary. Using different methods to prepare rat liver plasma membranes, which have been subjected to digitonin extraction, hr CN PAGE, immunoblotting, and mass spectrometry analysis, we demonstrate the presence of ecto-F0F1 complexes which have a similar molecular weight to the monomeric form of the mitochondrial complexes, containing both nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded subunits. This finding makes it unlikely that the enzyme assembles on the plasma membranes, but suggest it to be transported whole after being assembled in mitochondria by still unknown pathways. Moreover, the plasma membrane preparation enriched in basolateral proteins contains much higher amounts of complete and active F0F1 complexes, consistent with their specific function to modulate the HDL uptake on hepatocyte surface.},

abstract = {Under a variety of (patho) physiological conditions, leukocytes will leave the bloodstream by crossing the endothelial monolayer that lines the vessels and migrate into the underlying tissues. It is now clear that the process of extravasation involves a range of adhesion molecules on both leukocytes and endothelial cells, as well as extensive intracellular signaling that drives adhesion and chemotaxis on the one hand and controls a transient modulation of endothelial integrity on the other. We review here the current knowledge of the intracellular signaling pathways that are activated in the context of transendothelial migration in leukocytes and in endothelial cells. In leukocytes, polarization of receptors and of the signaling machinery is of key importance to drive adhesion and directional migration. Subsequent adhesion-induced signaling in endothelial cells, mediated by Rho-like GTPases and reactive oxygen species, induces a transient and focal loss of endothelial cell-cell adhesion to allow transmigration of the leukocyte. This review underscores the notion that we have likely just scratched the surface in revealing the complexity of the signaling that controls leukocyte transendothelial migration.},

abstract = {Depending on the strength of signal dose, CD40 receptor (CD40) controls ERK-1/2 and p38MAPK activation. At low signal dose, ERK-1/2 is maximally phosphorylated but p38MAPK is minimally phosphorylated; as the signal dose increases, ERK-1/2 phosphorylation is reduced whereas p38MAPK phosphorylation is reciprocally enhanced. The mechanism of reciprocal activation of these two MAPKs remains un-elucidated. Here, our computational model, coupled to experimental perturbations, shows that the observed reciprocity is a system-level behavior of an assembly of kinases arranged in two modules. Experimental perturbations with kinase inhibitors suggest that a minimum of two trans-modular negative feedback loops are required to reproduce the experimentally observed reciprocity. The bi-modular architecture of the signaling pathways endows the system with an inherent plasticity which is further expressed in the skewing of the CD40-induced productions of IL-10 and IL-12, the respective anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Targeting the plasticity of CD40 signaling significantly reduces Leishmania major infection in a susceptible mouse strain. Thus, for the first time, using CD40 signaling as a model, we show how a bi-modular assembly of kinases imposes reciprocity to a receptor signaling. The findings unravel that the signalling plasticity is inherent to a reciprocal system and that the principle can be used for designing a therapy.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Despite the availability of advanced clinical diagnostic systems, the overall 5-year survival rate for patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has remained relatively poor over the past 2 decades. Appropriate animal models need to be developed according to the specific purpose of cancer research. However, most of the currently available oral cancer cell lines do not precisely reflect the characteristics of bone-invasive OSCC and cannot serve as suitable tools in the development of new therapeutic reagents against bone-invasive OSCC. Here, we assessed the orthotopic and osteolytic mouse model with newly established OSCC cell line. DESIGN: We assessed the orthotopic and osteolytic mouse model using the newly established OSCC cells. In addition, the incidences of tumorigenesis and histopathological results were determined. RESULTS: The newly established YD-39 cell line grows in a monolayer sheet and has highly invasive. The transplanted YD-39 cells developed stable tumours in the tongues and calvaria region of the nude mice. The tumours in nude mice grafted with YD-39 cells had a high incidence of transplantability in both mouse models tested and a similar morphology to their respective original tumour. Therefore, both animal models might be feasible animal models to assess the efficacy of anti-cancer drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This type of animal model approach might be has the added advantage of potentially accelerating the biological discovery process.},

However, UVA-induced signal transduction to downstream ribosomal protein S6 kinases, p70(S6K) and p90(RSK), is not well understood. In this report, we show that UVA stimulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may lead to activation of p70(S6K)/p90(RSK) through phosphatidyl isositol (PI)-3 kinase and extracellular receptor-activated kinases (ERKs). Evidence is provided that phosphorylation and activation of p70(S6K)/p90(RSK) induced by UVA were prevented in Egfr(-/-) cells and were also markedly inhibited by the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors AG1478 and PD153035. Furthermore, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors and EGFR deficiency significantly suppressed activation of PI-3 kinase and ERKs in regulating activation of p90(RSK)/p70(S6K) but had no effect on activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) and p38 kinase in response to UVA. Thus, our results suggest that UVA-induced EGFR signaling may be required for activation of p90(RSK)/p70(S6K), PI-3 kinase, and ERKs but not JNKs or p38 kinase.},

abstract = {The facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 plays a key role in regulating whole body glucose homeostasis. GLUT4 dramatically changes its distribution upon insulin stimulation, and insulin-resistant diabetes is often linked with compromised translocation of GLUT4 under insulin stimulation. To elucidate the functional significance of the sole N-glycan chain on GLUT4, wild-type GLUT4 and a GLUT4 glycosylation mutant conjugated with enhanced GFP were stably expressed in HeLa cells. The N-glycan contributed to the overall stability of newly synthesized GLUT4. Moreover, cell surface expression of wild-type GLUT4 in HeLa cells was elevated upon insulin treatment, whereas the glycosylation mutant lost the ability to respond to insulin. Subcellular distribution of the mutant was distinct from that of wild-type GLUT4, implying that the subcellular localization required for insulin-mediated translocation was impaired in the mutant protein. Interestingly, kifunensine-treated cells also lost sensitivity to insulin, suggesting the functional importance of the N-glycan structure for GLUT4 trafficking. The K(m) or turnover rates of wild-type and mutant GLUT4, however, were similar, suggesting that the N-glycan had little effect on transporter activity. These findings underscore the critical roles of the N-glycan chain in quality control as well as intracellular trafficking of GLUT4.},

V., Guruswamy, S., Cao, K. T., Pessin, J. E., and Olson, A. L. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 14285-14292). Our studies demonstrated that an MEF2 binding site within this region was necessary, but not sufficient, for GLUT4 promoter function in transgenic mice. We have identified a second regulatory element (Domain I) that functions cooperatively with the MEF2 domain in regulating GLUT4 transcription. Using a yeast-one hybrid screen, we obtained a partial cDNA and generated an antibody directed against a protein binding specifically to Domain I. Sequence analysis of the partial cDNA indicates that the protein binding to Domain I is a novel protein. The antibody specifically labels two proteins of approximately 70 and 50 kDa in Western blot analysis. These molecular masses correspond to Domain I binding proteins identified by UV-cross-linking nuclear extracts to a Domain I probe. The antibody raised against the Domain I binding protein inhibited formation of a Domain I-protein complex in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. We conclude that we have identified an authentic, novel, Domain I binding protein required for transcriptional regulation of the human GLUT4 promoter.},

Currently, Stevia extracts are largely used as a noncaloric high-potency biosweetener alternative to sugar, due to the growing incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic disorders worldwide. Despite the large number of studies on Stevia and steviol glycosides in vivo, little is reported concerning the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects on human health. The effect of four commercial Stevia extracts on glucose transport activity was evaluated in HL-60 human leukaemia and in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The extracts were able to enhance glucose uptake in both cellular lines, as efficiently as insulin. Our data suggest that steviol glycosides could act by modulating GLUT translocation through the PI3K/Akt pathway since treatments with both insulin and Stevia extracts increased the phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt. Furthermore, Stevia extracts were able to revert the effect of the reduction of glucose uptake caused by methylglyoxal, an inhibitor of the insulin receptor/PI3K/Akt pathway. These results corroborate the hypothesis that Stevia extracts could mimic insulin effects modulating PI3K/Akt pathway.},

abstract = {GLUT4 is an insulin-regulated glucose transporter that is responsible for insulin-regulated glucose uptake into fat and muscle cells. In the absence of insulin, GLUT4 is mainly found in intracellular vesicles referred to as GLUT4 storage vesicles (GSVs). Here, we summarise evidence for the existence of these specific vesicles, how they are sequestered inside the cell and how they undergo exocytosis in the presence of insulin. In response to insulin stimulation, GSVs fuse with the plasma membrane in a rapid burst and in the continued presence of insulin GLUT4 molecules are internalised and recycled back to the plasma membrane in vesicles that are distinct from GSVs and probably of endosomal origin. In this Commentary we discuss evidence that this delivery process is tightly regulated and involves numerous molecules. Key components include the actin cytoskeleton, myosin motors, several Rab GTPases, the exocyst, SNARE proteins and SNARE regulators. Each step in this process is carefully orchestrated in a sequential and coupled manner and we are beginning to dissect key nodes within this network that determine vesicle-membrane fusion in response to insulin. This regulatory process clearly involves the Ser/Thr kinase AKT and the exquisite manner in which this single metabolic process is regulated makes it a likely target for lesions that might contribute to metabolic disease.},

Intravital microscopy enables multi-modal and multi-scale monitoring of cancer progression as a dynamic step-wise process within anatomic and functional niches provided by the microenvironment. These niches deliver cell-derived and matrix-derived signals that enable cell subsets or single cancer cells to survive, migrate, grow, undergo dormancy, and escape immune surveillance. Beyond basic research, intravital microscopy has reached preclinical application to identify mechanisms of tumour-stroma interactions and outcome. We here summarise how n-dimensional 'dynamic histopathology' of tumours by intravital microscopy shapes mechanistic insight into cell-cell and cell-tissue interactions that underlie single-cell and collective cancer invasion, metastatic seeding at distant sites, immune evasion, and therapy responses.},

abstract = {Despite being one of the first recognized targets of insulin action, the acceleration of glucose transport into muscle and fat tissue remains one of the most enigmatic processes in the insulin action cascade. Glucose transport is accomplished by a shift in the distribution of the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular compartments to the plasma membrane in the presence of insulin. The complexity in deciphering the molecular blueprint of insulin regulation of glucose transport arises because it represents a convergence of two convoluted biological systems—vesicular transport and signal transduction. Whereas more than 60 molecular players have been implicated in this orchestral performance, it has been difficult to distinguish between mainly passive participants vs. those that are clearly driving the process. The maze-like nature of the endosomal system makes it almost impossible to dissect the anatomical nature of what appears to be a medley of many overlapping and rapidly changing...},

Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4) is an important regulator of embryonic stem cell fate. Here, we investigated whether Oct4 regulates stemness of head and neck squamous carcinoma (HNSC) CSCs. Our study showed that ectopic expression of Oct4 promotes tumor growth through cyclin E activation, increases chemoresistance through ABCC6 expression and enhances tumor invasion through slug expression. Also, Oct4 dedifferentiates differentiated HNSC cells to CSC-like cells. Furthermore, Oct4(high) HNSC CSCs have more stem cell-like traits compared with Oct4(low) cells, such as self-renewal, stem cell markers' expression, chemoresistance, invasion capacity and xenograft tumorigeneity in vitro and in vivo. In addition, knockdown of Oct4 led to markedly lower HNSC CSC stemness. Finally, there was a significant correlation between Oct4 expression and survival of 119 HNSC patients. Collectively, these data suggest that Oct4 may be a critical regulator of HNSC CSCs and its targeting may be potentially valuable in the treatment of HNSC CSCs.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Extracapsular spread (ECS) to the cervical lymph nodes is a major adverse prognostic factor in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We prospectively examined the value of FDG PET immediately before postoperative radiotherapy/concurrent chemoradiotherapy (pre-RT/CCRT PET) to detect residual/relapsing disease in the early postsurgical follow-up period in high-risk OSCC patients with ECS.

METHODS: We examined 183 high-risk OSCC patients with ECS who underwent preoperative FDG PET/CT for staging purposes. Of these patients, 29 underwent a second pre-RT/CCRT FDG PET/CT scan. The clinical utility of the second FDG PET/CT was examined using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis.

RESULTS: Patients who underwent the second FDG PET/CT scan had baseline clinicopathological characteristics similar to those who did not undergo a second scan. Of the patients who underwent the second scan, seven (24 {\%}) had unexpected, newly discovered lesions. Five eventually died of the disease, and two had no evidence of recurrence after a change in RT field and dose. In an event-based analysis at 2 months, rates of neck control (6/29 vs. 6/154, p = 0.001), distant metastases (3/29 vs. 4/154, p = 0.046), and disease-free survival (7/29 vs. 10/154, p = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients who received a second PET scan than in those who did not. The second pre-RT/CCRT PET scan was of particular benefit for detecting new lesions in OSCC patients with both ECS and lymph node standardized uptake value (SUV) of ≥ 5.2 in the first PET scan.

CONCLUSION: The present findings support the clinical value of pre-RT/CCRT FDG PET for defining treatment strategy in OSCC patients with both ECS and high nodal SUV, even when FDG PET had already been performed during the initial staging work-up.},

New advances in intravital microscopy (IVM), such as two-photon microscopy, imaging chambers, and multicolor and fluorescent resonance energy transfer imaging, have recently been used to visualize the behavior of single metastasizing cells at subcellular resolution over several days, yielding new and unexpected insights into this process. For example, IVM studies showed that tumor cells can switch between multiple invasion strategies in response to various densities of extracellular matrix. Moreover, other IVM studies showed that tumor cell migration and blood entry take place not only at the invasive front, but also within the tumor mass at tumor-associated vessels that lack an intact basement membrane. In this Commentary, we will give an overview of the recent advances in high-resolution IVM techniques and discuss some of the latest insights in the metastasis field obtained with IVM.},

abstract = {Abnormal cellular metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, yet there is an absence of quantitative methods to dynamically image this powerful cellular function. Optical metabolic imaging (OMI) is a noninvasive, high-resolution, quantitative tool for monitoring cellular metabolism. OMI probes the fluorescence intensities and lifetimes of the autofluorescent metabolic coenzymes reduced NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide. We confirm that OMI correlates with cellular glycolytic levels across a panel of human breast cell lines using standard assays of cellular rates of glucose uptake and lactate secretion (P {\textless} 0.05, r = 0.89). In addition, OMI resolves differences in the basal metabolic activity of untransformed from malignant breast cells (P {\textless} 0.05) and between breast cancer subtypes (P {\textless} 0.05), defined by estrogen receptor and/or HER2 expression or absence. In vivo OMI is sensitive to metabolic changes induced by inhibition of HER2 with the antibody trastuzumab (herceptin) in HER2-overexpressing human breast cancer xenografts in mice. This response was confirmed with tumor growth curves and stains for Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3. OMI resolved trastuzumab-induced changes in cellular metabolism in vivo as early as 48 hours posttreatment (P {\textless} 0.05), whereas fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography did not resolve any changes with trastuzumab up to 12 days posttreatment (P {\textgreater} 0.05). In addition, OMI resolved cellular subpopulations of differing response in vivo that are critical for investigating drug resistance mechanisms. Importantly, OMI endpoints remained unchanged with trastuzumab treatment in trastuzumab-resistant xenografts (P {\textgreater} 0.05). OMI has significant implications for rapid cellular-level assessment of metabolic response to molecular expression and drug action, which would greatly accelerate drug development studies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hazard ratios are ubiquitously used in time to event applications to quantify adjusted covariate effects. Although hazard ratios are invaluable for hypothesis testing, other adjusted measures of association, both relative and absolute, should be provided to fully appreciate studies results. The corrected group prognosis method is generally used to estimate the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to be treated for categorical covariates.

METHODS: The goal of this paper is to present transformation models for time-to-event outcomes to obtain, directly from estimated coefficients, the measures of association widely used in biostatistics together with their confidence interval. Pseudo-values are used for a practical estimation of transformation models.

RESULTS: Using the regression model estimated through pseudo-values with suitable link functions, relative risks, risk differences and the number needed to treat, are obtained together with their confidence intervals. One example based on literature data and one original application to the study of prognostic factors in primary retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcomas are presented. A simulation study is used to show some properties of the different estimation methods.

CONCLUSIONS: Clinically useful measures of treatment or exposure effect are widely available in epidemiology. When time to event outcomes are present, the analysis is performed generally resorting to predicted values from Cox regression model. It is now possible to resort to more general regression models, adopting suitable link functions and pseudo values for estimation, to obtain alternative measures of effect directly from regression coefficients together with their confidence interval. This may be especially useful when, in presence of time dependent covariate effects, it is not straightforward to specify the correct, if any, time dependent functional form. The method can easily be implemented with standard software.},

abstract = {Alpha actinins (ACTNs) are known for their ability to modulate cytoskeletal organization and cell motility by cross-linking actin filaments. We show here that ACTN4 harbors a functional LXXLL receptor interaction motif, interacts with nuclear receptors in vitro and in mammalian cells, and potently activates transcription mediated by nuclear receptors. Whereas overexpression of ACTN4 potentiates estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$)-mediated transcription in transient transfection reporter assays, knockdown of ACTN4 decreases it. In contrast, histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) inhibits estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$)-mediated transcription. Moreover, the ACTN4 mutant lacking the CaM (calmodulin)-like domain that is required for its interaction with HDAC7 fails to activate transcription by ER$\alpha$. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that maximal associations of ACTN4 and HDAC7 with the pS2 promoter are mutually exclusive. Knockdown of ACTN4 significantly decreases the expression of ER$\alpha$ target genes including pS2 and PR and also affects cell proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with or without hormone, whereas knockdown of HDAC7 exhibits opposite effects. Interestingly, overexpression of wild-type ACTN4, but not the mutants defective in interacting with ER$\alpha$ or HDAC7, results in an increase in pS2 and PR mRNA accumulation in a hormone-dependent manner. In summary, we have identified ACTN4 as a novel, atypical coactivator that regulates transcription networks to control cell growth.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin-dependent glucose influx in skeletal muscle and adipocytes is believed to rely largely on GLUT4, but this has not been confirmed directly. We assessed the relative functional contribution of GLUT4 in experimental models of skeletal muscle and adipocytes using the HIV-1 protease inhibitor indinavir.

METHODS: Indinavir (up to 100 micro mol/l) was added to the glucose transport solution after insulin stimulation of wild-type L6 muscle cells, L6 cells over-expressing either GLUT4myc or GLUT1myc, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, isolated mouse brown or white adipocytes, and isolated mouse muscle preparations.

RESULTS: 100 micro mol/l indinavir inhibited 80{\%} of both basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake in L6GLUT4myc myotubes and myoblasts, but only 25{\%} in L6GLUT1myc cells. Cell-surface density of glucose transporters was not affected. In isolated soleus and extensor digitorum longus muscles, primary white and brown adipocytes, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was inhibited 70 to 80{\%} by indinavir. The effect of indinavir on glucose uptake was variable in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, averaging 45{\%} and 67{\%} inhibition of basal and maximally insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, respectively. In this cell, fractional inhibition of glucose uptake by indinavir correlated positively with the fold-stimulation of glucose uptake by insulin, and was higher with sub-maximal insulin concentrations. The latter finding coincided with an increase only in GLUT4, but not GLUT1, in plasma membrane lawns.

CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Indinavir is a useful tool to assess different functional contributions of GLUT4 to glucose uptake in common models of skeletal muscle and adipocytes.},

While the mitochondrial synthase utilizes the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation to power ATP synthesis, the cell surface synthase has instead been implicated in numerous activities, including the mediation of intracellular pH, cellular response to antiangiogenic agents, and cholesterol homeostasis. Intriguingly, a common thread uniting these various models of cell surface ATP synthase functions is the apparently caveolar distribution of the enzyme.

abstract = {Mathematical models of mitochondrial bioenergetics provide powerful analytical tools to help interpret experimental data and facilitate experimental design for elucidating the supporting biochemical and physical processes. As a next step towards constructing a complete physiologically faithful mitochondrial bioenergetics model, a mathematical model was developed targeting the cardiac mitochondrial bioenergetic based upon previous efforts, and corroborated using both transient and steady state data. The model consists of several modified rate functions of mitochondrial bioenergetics, integrated calcium dynamics and a detailed description of the K(+)-cycle and its effect on mitochondrial bioenergetics and matrix volume regulation. Model simulations were used to fit 42 adjustable parameters to four independent experimental data sets consisting of 32 data curves. During the model development, a certain network topology had to be in place and some assumptions about uncertain or unobserved experimental factors and conditions were explicitly constrained in order to faithfully reproduce all the data sets. These realizations are discussed, and their necessity helps contribute to the collective understanding of the mitochondrial bioenergetics.},

abstract = {In contrast to normal differentiated cells, which rely primarily on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate the energy needed for cellular processes, most cancer cells instead rely on aerobic glycolysis, a phenomenon termed "the Warburg effect." Aerobic glycolysis is an inefficient way to generate adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), however, and the advantage it confers to cancer cells has been unclear. Here we propose that the metabolism of cancer cells, and indeed all proliferating cells, is adapted to facilitate the uptake and incorporation of nutrients into the biomass (e.g., nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids) needed to produce a new cell. Supporting this idea are recent studies showing that (i) several signaling pathways implicated in cell proliferation also regulate metabolic pathways that incorporate nutrients into biomass; and that (ii) certain cancer-associated mutations enable cancer cells to acquire and metabolize nutrients in a manner conducive to proliferation rather than efficient ATP production. A better understanding of the mechanistic links between cellular metabolism and growth control may ultimately lead to better treatments for human cancer.},

@article{Gibson2011,
abstract = {Background: Tumors ferment glucose to lactate even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis; Warburg effect). This nonoxidative conversion of glucose to lactate is activated by transketolase, an enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. For maintaining accelerated metabolism, tumors are known to have high requirements for glucose and thus have increased transport of glucose across the plasma membrane. Metabolic dependence of tumors on glucose utilization has been characterized by three genes; GLUT1, GLUT 4 and TKTL1/2. However, the expression patterns of the genes have not been explored fully for early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study we studied the expression pattern of these genes in colonic carcinogenesis (rat-AOM model and human CRC) and chemoprevention (by studying the effect of celecoxib in, Caco-2 and HCT-116 cell lines). Methods: Immunohistochemical expression of GLUT1, GLUT4, and TKTL1/2 was analyzed in human colon caner tissue array (consisting of 36 cases of colonic cancers and 12 cases each of normal, inflammatory and benign tumor tissues of the colon). In addition we analyzed 14 week AOM-treated rat colon tissue samples (early stage of colorectal carcinogenesis model) and saline-treated samples. Caco-2 and HCT-116 CRC cells were treated with 50muM celecoxib for 72hrs. Further analysis was carried out through real-time PCR using TKTL (1 {\&} 2), GLUT (1 {\&}4), PCNA and beta-actin (control) Taqman probes. Results: Our results reveal an increased expression of GLUT1, GLUT4 and TKTL1/2 during CRC progression from adenoma to mucinous adenocarcinoma (Table 1). Increased expression of these genes was evident during early onset of carcinogenesis as shown in 14 week AOM-treated rat colon. Lastly, the cell culture data revealed that celecoxib caused a significant reduction in the expression of these metabolic markers in Caco-2 (p{\textless}.01) or HCT-116 (p{\textless}.05). These changes corresponded to the reduction in the proliferation marker PCNA in Caco-2 (95{\%}) or in HCT-116 cells (39{\%}) (Table 2). Conclusions: We, herein, demonstrate that expression of GLUT 1, GLUT4, and TKTL1/2 is significantly altered during early CRC and are key factors in cancer progression. Our studies show a significant increase in the glucose transporter 1 and 4, in relationship to cancer progression and early stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, thereby proposing potential biomarker role for these markers. TKTL1/2, on the other hand, seems to be up regulated in only a few of human colorectal tumors, which portends it to be a subset-specific biomarker. We further demonstrate that chemopreventive properties of celecoxib against colorectal cancer (Caco-2 and HCT-116 cells) may be modulated by the metabolic mediators involved in glycolysis. Further studies are needed to access the clinical application of these receptors as potential biomarkers for colorectal cancer. (Table presented).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tissue MicroArray technology aims to perform immunohistochemical staining on hundreds of different tissue samples simultaneously. It allows faster analysis, considerably reducing costs incurred in staining. A time consuming phase of the methodology is the selection of tissue areas within paraffin blocks: no utilities have been developed for the identification of areas to be punched from the donor block and assembled in the recipient block.

RESULTS: The presented work supports, in the specific case of a primary subtype of breast cancer (tubular breast cancer), the semi-automatic discrimination and localization between normal and pathological regions within the tissues. The diagnosis is performed by analysing specific morphological features of the sample such as the absence of a double layer of cells around the lumen and the decay of a regular glands-and-lobules structure. These features are analysed using an algorithm which performs the extraction of morphological parameters from images and compares them to experimentally validated threshold values. Results are satisfactory since in most of the cases the automatic diagnosis matches the response of the pathologists. In particular, on a total of 1296 sub-images showing normal and pathological areas of breast specimens, algorithm accuracy, sensitivity and specificity are respectively 89{\%}, 84{\%} and 94{\%}.

CONCLUSIONS: The proposed work is a first attempt to demonstrate that automation in the Tissue MicroArray field is feasible and it can represent an important tool for scientists to cope with this high-throughput technique.},

UV irradiation being a common stressor of skin, we looked at the effect of UVB on HIF-1$\alpha$ expression in keratinocytes. We found that UVB induces a biphasic HIF-1$\alpha$ variation through reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Whereas rapid production of cytoplasmic ROS down-regulates HIF-1$\alpha$ expression, delayed mitochondrial ROS generation results in its up-regulation. Indeed, activation of p38 MAPK and JNK1 mediated by mitochondrial ROS were required for HIF-1$\alpha$ phosphorylation and accumulation after UVB irradiation. Our experiments also revealed a key role of HIF-1$\alpha$ in mediating UVB-induced apoptosis. We conclude that the broad impact of the HIF-1 transcription factor on gene expression could make it a key regulator of UV-responsive genes and photocarcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Genome-wide mRNA expression measurements can identify molecular signatures of cancer and are anticipated to improve patient management. Such expression profiles are currently being critically evaluated based on an apparent instability in gene composition and the limited overlap between signatures from different studies. We have recently identified a primary tumor signature for detection of lymph node metastasis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Before starting a large multicenter prospective validation, we have thoroughly evaluated the composition of this signature. A multiple training approach was used for validating the original set of predictive genes. Based on different combinations of training samples, multiple signatures were assessed for predictive accuracy and gene composition. The initial set of predictive genes is a subset of a larger group of 825 genes with predictive power. Many of the predictive genes are interchangeable because of a similar expression pattern across the tumor samples. The head and neck metastasis signature has a more stable gene composition than previous predictors. Exclusion of the strongest predictive genes could be compensated by raising the number of genes included in the signature. Multiple accurate predictive signatures can be designed using various subsets of predictive genes. The absence of genes with strong predictive power can be compensated by including more genes with lower predictive power. Lack of overlap between predictive signatures from different studies with the same goal may be explained by the fact that there are more predictive genes than required to design an accurate predictor.},

PKM2 engages in parallel, feed-forward, positive and negative feedback control contributing to cancer progression. Besides its metabolic role, non-metabolic functions of PKM2 as protein kinase and transcriptional coactivator for c-MYC and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha are essential for epidermal growth factor receptor activation-induced tumorigenesis. These biochemical activities are controlled by a shift in the oligomeric state of PKM2 that includes acetylation, oxidation, phosphorylation, prolyl hydroxylation and sumoylation. Metabolically active PKM2 tetramer is allosterically regulated and responds to nutritional and stress signals. Metabolically inactive PKM2 dimer is imported into the nucleus and can function as protein kinase stimulating transcription. A systems biology approach to PKM2 at the genome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome and fluxome level reveals how differences in biomolecular structure translate into a global rewiring of cancer metabolism.

The focus of this review is on the latest developments in imaging MS. Selected biological applications are employed to illustrate some of the novel features discussed. Two commonly used MS imaging techniques, secondary ion mass spectrometric (SIMS) imaging and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometric imaging, center this review. New instrumental developments are discussed that extend spatial resolution, mass resolving power, mass accuracy, tandem-MS capabilities, and offer new gas-phase separation capabilities for both imaging techniques. It will be shown how the success of MS imaging is crucially dependent on sample preparation protocols as they dictate the nature and mass range of detected biomolecules that can be imaged.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a highly lethal cancer that contains cellular and functional heterogeneity. Previously, we enriched a subpopulation of highly tumorigenic head and neck cancer initiating cells (HN-CICs) from HNSCC. However, the molecular mechanisms by which to govern the characteristics of HN-CICs remain unclear. GRP78, a stress-inducible endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, has been reported to play a crucial role in the maintenance of embryonic stem cells, but the role of GRP78 in CICs has not been elucidated.

RESULTS: Initially, we recognized GRP78 as a putative candidate on mediating the stemness and tumorigenic properties of HN-CICs by differential systemic analyses. Subsequently, cells with GRP78 anchored at the plasma membrane (memGRP78+) exerted cancer stemness properties of self-renewal, differentiation and radioresistance. Of note, xenotransplantation assay indicated merely 100 memGRP78+ HNSCCs resulted in tumor growth. Moreover, knockdown of GRP78 significantly reduced the self-renewal ability, side population cells and expression of stemness genes, but inversely promoted cell differentiation and apoptosis in HN-CICs. Targeting GRP78 also lessened tumorigenicity of HN-CICs both in vitro and in vivo. Clinically, co-expression of GRP78 and Nanog predicted the worse survival prognosis of HNSCC patients by immunohistochemical analyses. Finally, depletion of GRP78 in HN-CICs induced the expression of Bax, Caspase 3, and PTEN.

CONCLUSIONS: In summary, memGRP78 should be a novel surface marker for isolation of HN-CICs, and targeting GRP78 signaling might be a potential therapeutic strategy for HNSCC through eliminating HN-CICs.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Diabetes is more common in cancer survivors than in the general population. The objective of the present study was to determine cancer frequency in a cohort of patients with diabetes and to examine demographic, clinical, and quality of life differences between cancer survivors and their cancer-free peers to inform better individualized care.

METHODS: Self-reported survey data from 3,466 registrants with type 2 diabetes from Australia's National Diabetes Services Scheme (NDSS) were analyzed to compare relevant variables between cancer survivors and cancer-free patients. Analyses were focused on breast and prostate cancer to reflect the most common cancers in women and men, respectively.

RESULTS: Five percent of diabetic women reported a history of breast cancer and 4.2{\%} of men reported a history of prostate cancer. Diabetic patients with a history of breast or prostate cancer were older at time of survey and diabetes diagnosis, less likely to report metformin use (women), and more likely to have two or more comorbidities than their cancer-free peers. More diabetic prostate cancer survivors also reported problems with mobility and performing usual tasks. However, cancer-free diabetic subjects reported a lower diabetes-dependent quality of life than diabetic cancer survivors. There was no association between cancer survivorship and duration of diabetes, indices of glycemic control, obesity, or diabetic complications.

CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors comprise a significant minority of diabetic patients that are particularly vulnerable and may benefit from interventions to increase screening and treatment of other comorbidities and promote a healthy lifestyle.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: PURPOSE To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression-based "intrinsic" subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. METHODS A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.

RESULTS: The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97{\%}. CONCLUSION Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Here, we report the facile preparation of tunable magnetic Ni-doped near-infrared (NIR) quantum dots (MNIR-QDs) as an efficient probe for targeting, imaging, and cellular sorting applications. We synthesized the MNIR-QDs via a hot colloidal synthesis approach to yield monodisperse and tunable QDs. These hydrophobic QDs were structurally and compositionally characterized and further functionalized with amino-PEG and carboxyl-PEG to improve their biocompatibility. Since QDs are known to be toxic due to the presence of cadmium, we have evaluated the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of our surface-functionalized MNIR-QDs. Our results revealed that surface-functionalized MNIR-QDs did not exhibit significant toxicity at the concentrations used in the experiments and are therefore suitable for biological applications. For further in vitro applications, we covalently linked folic acid to the surface of amino-PEG-coated MNIR-QDs through NHS chemistry to target the folate receptors largely present in the HeLa cells to demonstrate the specific targeting and magnetic behavior of these MNIR-QDs. Improved specificity has been observed with treatment of HeLa cells with the folic acid-linked amino PEG-coated MNIR QDs (FA-PEG-MNIR-QDs) compared to the one without folic acid. Since the synthesized probe has magnetic property, we have also successfully demonstrated sorting between the cells which have taken up the probe with the use of a magnet. Our findings strongly suggest that these functionalized MNIR-QDs can be a potential probe for targeting, cellular sorting, and bioimaging applications.},

abstract = {The functional and therapeutic importance of the Warburg effect is increasingly recognized, and glycolysis has become a target of anticancer strategies. We recently reported the identification of a group of novel small compounds that inhibit basal glucose transport and reduce cancer cell growth by a glucose deprivation-like mechanism. We hypothesized that the compounds target Glut1 and are efficacious in vivo as anticancer agents. Here, we report that a novel representative compound WZB117 not only inhibited cell growth in cancer cell lines but also inhibited cancer growth in a nude mouse model. Daily intraperitoneal injection of WZB117 at 10 mg/kg resulted in a more than 70{\%} reduction in the size of human lung cancer of A549 cell origin. Mechanism studies showed that WZB117 inhibited glucose transport in human red blood cells (RBC), which express Glut1 as their sole glucose transporter. Cancer cell treatment with WZB117 led to decreases in levels of Glut1 protein, intracellular ATP, and glycolytic enzymes. All these changes were followed by increase in ATP-sensing enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and declines in cyclin E2 as well as phosphorylated retinoblastoma, resulting in cell-cycle arrest, senescence, and necrosis. Addition of extracellular ATP rescued compound-treated cancer cells, suggesting that the reduction of intracellular ATP plays an important role in the anticancer mechanism of the molecule. Senescence induction and the essential role of ATP were reported for the first time in Glut1 inhibitor-treated cancer cells. Thus, WZB117 is a prototype for further development of anticancer therapeutics targeting Glut1-mediated glucose transport and glucose metabolism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Traditional in vitro cell invasion assays focus on measuring one cell parameter at a time and are often less than ideal in terms of reproducibility and quantification. Further, many techniques are not suitable for quantifying the advancing margin of collectively migrating cells, arguably the most important area of activity during tumor invasion. We have developed and applied a highly quantitative, standardized, reproducible Nest Expansion Assay (NEA) to measure cancer cell invasion in vitro, which builds upon established wound-healing techniques. This assay involves creating uniform circular "nests" of cells within a monolayer of cells using a stabilized, silicone-tipped drill press, and quantifying the margin expansion into an overlaid extracellular matrix (ECM)-like component using computer-assisted applications.

FINDINGS: The NEA was applied to two human-derived breast cell lines, MCF10A and MCF10A-CA1d, which exhibit opposite degrees of tumorigenicity and invasion in vivo. Assays were performed to incorporate various microenvironmental conditions, in order to test their influence on cell behavior and measures. Two types of computer-driven image analysis were performed using Java's freely available ImageJ software and its FracLac plugin to capture nest expansion and fractal dimension, respectively - which are both taken as indicators of invasiveness. Both analyses confirmed that the NEA is highly reproducible, and that the ECM component is key in defining invasive cell behavior. Interestingly, both analyses also detected significant differences between non-invasive and invasive cell lines, across various microenvironments, and over time.

CONCLUSION: The spatial nature of the NEA makes its outcome susceptible to the global influence of many cellular parameters at once (e.g., motility, protease secretion, cell-cell adhesion). We propose the NEA as a mid-throughput technique for screening and simultaneous examination of factors contributing to cancer cell invasion, particularly suitable for parameterizing and validating Cancer Systems Biology approaches such as mathematical modeling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biomarkers allowing the characterization of malignancy and therapy response of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCC) or other types of carcinomas are still outstanding. The biochemical suicide molecule endonuclease DNaseX (DNaseI-like 1) has been used to identify the Apo10 protein epitope that marks tumor cells with abnormal apoptosis and proliferation. The transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) represents the enzymatic basis for an anaerobic glucose metabolism even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis/Warburg effect), which is concomitant with a more malignant phenotype due to invasive growth/metastasis and resistance to radical and apoptosis inducing therapies.

METHODS: Expression of Apo10 and TKTL1 was analysed retrospectively in OSCC specimen (n = 161) by immunohistochemistry. Both markers represent independent markers for poor survival. Furthermore Apo10 and TKTL1 have been used prospectively for epitope detection in monocytes (EDIM)-blood test in patients with OSCC (n = 50), breast cancer (n = 48), prostate cancer (n = 115), and blood donors/controls (n = 74).

RESULTS: Positive Apo10 and TKTL1 expression were associated with recurrence of the tumor. Multivariate analysis demonstrated Apo10 and TKTL1 expression as an independent prognostic factor for reduced tumor-specific survival. Apo10+/TKTL1+ subgroup showed the worst disease-free survival rate in OSCC.EDIM-Apo10 and EDIM-TKTL1 blood tests allowed a sensitive and specific detection of patients with OSCC, breast cancer and prostate cancer before surgery and in after care. A combined score of Apo10+/TKTL1+ led to a sensitivity of 95.8{\%} and a specificity of 97.3{\%} for the detection of carcinomas independent of the tumor entity.

CONCLUSIONS: The combined detection of two independent fundamental biophysical processes by the two biomarkers Apo10 and TKTL1 allows a sensitive and specific detection of neoplasia in a noninvasive and cost-effective way. Further prospective trials are warranted to validate this new concept for the diagnosis of neoplasia and tumor recurrence.},

abstract = {Like all cancers, brain tumors require a continuous source of energy and molecular resources for new cell production. In normal brain, glucose is an essential neuronal fuel, but the blood-brain barrier limits its delivery. We now report that nutrient restriction contributes to tumor progression by enriching for brain tumor initiating cells (BTICs) owing to preferential BTIC survival and to adaptation of non-BTICs through acquisition of BTIC features. BTICs outcompete for glucose uptake by co-opting the high affinity neuronal glucose transporter, type 3 (Glut3, SLC2A3). BTICs preferentially express Glut3, and targeting Glut3 inhibits BTIC growth and tumorigenic potential. Glut3, but not Glut1, correlates with poor survival in brain tumors and other cancers; thus, tumor initiating cells may extract nutrients with high affinity. As altered metabolism represents a cancer hallmark, metabolic reprogramming may maintain the tumor hierarchy and portend poor prognosis.},

abstract = {Arecoline is the major alkaloid of areca nut (AN) and known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis. The metabolic sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), activated by ROS, also regulates apoptosis. This study used several types of cells as the experimental model to analyze the roles of ROS and AMPK in arecoline-induced apoptosis. We found that arecoline dose-dependently increased intracellular ROS level, and two antioxidants, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and glutathione, attenuated arecoline-induced apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, arecoline dose- and time-dependently inhibited rather than stimulated AMPK-Thr172 phosphorylation, and both NAC and glutathione relieved this inhibition. The AMPK activator, 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-$\beta$-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), also restored the phosphorylation level of AMPK-Thr172 and attenuated apoptotic cell death under arecoline insult. In contrast, the AMPK inhibitor, compound C, and RNA interference of AMPK expression increased the cytotoxicity of arecoline. Collectively, these results suggest that arecoline may inhibit AMPK through intracellular ROS, responsible for the execution of apoptosis.},

abstract = {The insulin-sensitive glucose transporter GLUT4 mediates the uptake of glucose into adipocytes and muscle cells. In this study we have used a novel 96-well plate fluorescence assay to study the kinetics of GLUT4 trafficking in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We have found evidence for a graded release mechanism whereby GLUT4 is released into the plasma membrane recycling system in a nonkinetic manner as follows: the kinetics of appearance of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane is independent of the insulin concentration; a large proportion of GLUT4 molecules do not participate in plasma membrane recycling in the absence of insulin; and with increasing insulin there is an incremental increase in the total number of GLUT4 molecules participating in the recycling pathway rather than simply an increased rate of recycling. We propose a model whereby GLUT4 is stored in a compartment that is disengaged from the plasma membrane recycling system in the basal state. In response to insulin, GLUT4 is quantally released from this compartment in a pulsatile manner, leaving some sequestered from the recycling pathway even in conditions of excess insulin. Once disengaged from this location we suggest that in the continuous presence of insulin this quanta of GLUT4 continuously recycles to the plasma membrane, possibly via non-endosomal carriers that are formed at the perinuclear region.},

Despite RalA and RalB sharing 82{\%} sequence identity and utilization of shared effector proteins, their roles in normal and neoplastic cell growth have been shown to be highly distinct. Here, we determined that RalB function is regulated by protein kinase C$\alpha$ (PKC$\alpha$) phosphorylation. We found that RalB phosphorylation on Ser-198 in the C-terminal membrane targeting sequence resulted in enhanced RalB endomembrane accumulation and decreased RalB association with its effector, the exocyst component Sec5. Additionally, RalB phosphorylation regulated vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion by regulating v- and t-SNARE interactions. RalB phosphorylation regulated vesicular traffic of $\alpha$5-integrin to the cell surface and cell attachment to fibronectin. In summary, our data suggest that phosphorylation by PKC$\alpha$ is critical for RalB-mediated vesicle trafficking and exocytosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) accounts for the majority of oral cancers. Despite recent advances in OSCC diagnostics and therapeutics, the overall survival rate still remains low. Here, we assessed the efficacy of a combinatorial arsenic trioxide (ATO) and cisplatin (CDDP) treatment in human OSCC cells.

METHODS: The combinatorial effect of ATO/CDDP on the growth and apoptosis of OSCC cell lines HSC-2, HSC-3, and HSC-4 was evaluated using MTT and annexin V assays, respectively. Chou-Talalay analyses were preformed to evaluate the combinatorial effects of ATO/CDDP on the dose-reduction index (DRI). To clarify the mechanism underlying the ATO/CDDP anticancer effect, we also examined the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ATO/CDDP-induced apoptosis.

RESULTS: Combination index (CI) analyses revealed that a synergistic interaction of ATO and CDDP elicits a wide range of effects in HSC-2 cells, with CI values ranging from 0.78 to 0.90, where CI {\textless} 1 defines synergism. The CI values in HSC-3 and HSC-4 cells ranged from 0.34 to 0.45 and from 0.60 to 0.92, respectively. In addition, ATO/CDDP yielded favorable DRI values ranging from 1.6-fold to 7.71-fold dose reduction. Compared to mono-therapy, ATO/CDDP combinatorial therapy significantly augmented the loss of mitochondrial potential, caspase-3/7 activity and subsequent apoptosis. These changes were all abrogated by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine.

CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first evidence for a synergistic ATO/CDDP anticancer (apoptotic) activity in OSCC cells with a favorable DRI, thereby highlighting its potential as a combinational therapeutic regime in OSCC.},

abstract = {Although recent studies in vitro and in vivo indicate that the polyphenol resveratrol (RSV) has anti-diabetic properties, the exact mechanisms involved are not known. In the present study, we examined the effects of RSV and the mechanism of regulation of glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. In L6 myotubes RSV (100 microM) induced maximum stimulation of glucose (2DG) uptake (201+/-8.90{\%} of control, p{\textless}0.001), an effect that was similar to insulin action. RSV-stimulated glucose uptake was abolished by AMPK inhibition. In the presence of the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, RSV-stimulated 2DG uptake and AMPK phosphorylation were abolished. RSV did not stimulate significant translocation of GLUT4 or GLUT1 transporters. However, treatment with indinavir, a GLUT4 specific inhibitor, blocked RSV-stimulated glucos e uptake. We propose that RSV elevates glucose uptake in muscle cells through a mechanism that involves sirtuins and AMPK and possibly stimulation of GLUT4 transporter intrinsic activity.=== == AMPK is an important energy sensor in mammalian cells [4]. In skeletal muscle cells AMPK may be activated by contraction or by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-$\beta$-d-ribofuranoside (AICAR) leading to increase in glucose uptake [5]. Metformin [6] and thiazolidinediones [7] which are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, have been shown to increase glucose uptake via AMPK. Our studies showed a rapid and significant increase in AMPK phosphorylation by RSV in agreement with other recent studies in hepatocytes [23] and C2C12 mouse muscle cells [12]. Using compound C, an inhibitor of AMPK, we demonstrated a significant reduction in RSV-stimulated glucose uptake providing support of the notion that AMPK is a mediator of the RSV effects on glucose uptake. We measured phosphorylation levels of mTOR, the downstream target of AMPK, and also p70 S6K, which is downstream of mTOR [29]. Activated AMPK results in inhibition of mTOR [19]. Our data show that RSV inhibited the phosphorylation of both mTOR and its downstream target p70 S6K. mTOR is also downstream of Akt [19]. However we did not see any changes in Akt phosphorylation with RSV.},

However, the validity of such associations assumes that there are no non-random influences of nuclear genes or other factors. Here, we removed the effect of any differences in nuclear genes by constructing transmitochondrial cybrids harbouring mitochondria with either haplogroup H or haplogroup T in cultured A549 human lung carcinoma cells with identical nuclear backgrounds. We compared the bioenergetic capacities and coupling efficiencies of mitochondria isolated from these cells, and of mitochondria retained within the cells, as a critical experimental test of the hypothesis that these haplogroups affect mitochondrial bioenergetics. We found that there were no functionally-important bioenergetic differences between mitochondria bearing these haplogroups, using either isolated mitochondria or mitochondria within cells.},

A central feature of this process is the coordinated accumulation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 into the plasma membrane. New signaling and cytoskeletal mechanisms of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 exocytosis are of emerging interest, particularly those at or just beneath the plasma membrane. This review examines signals that functionally engage GLUT4 exocytosis, considers cytoskeletal regulation of the stimulated GLUT4 itinerary, and appraises the involvement of plasma membrane parameters in GLUT4 control. We also explore how these newly-defined signaling, cytoskeletal and membrane mechanisms could be of therapeutic interest in the treatment and/or prevention of GLUT4 dysregulation in disease.},

abstract = {Tumorigenesis is associated with enhanced cellular glucose uptake and increased metabolism. Because the p53 tumor suppressor is mutated in a large number of cancers, we evaluated whether p53 regulates expression of the GLUT1 and GLUT4 glucose transporter genes. Transient cotransfection of osteosarcoma-derived SaOS-2 cells, rhabdomyosarcoma-derived RD cells, and C2C12 myotubes with GLUT1-P-Luc or GLUT4-P-Luc promoter-reporter constructs and wild-type p53 expression vectors dose dependently decreased both GLUT1 and GLUT4 promoter activity to approximately 50{\%} of their basal levels. PG(13)-Luc activity, which was used as a positive control for functional p53 expression, was increased up to approximately 250-fold by coexpression of wild-type p53. The inhibitory effect of wild-type p53 was greatly reduced or abolished when cells were transfected with p53 with mutations in amino acids 143, 248, or 273. A region spanning -66/+163 bp of the GLUT4 promoter was both necessary and sufficient to mediate the inhibitory effects of p53. Furthermore, in vitro translated p53 protein was found to bind directly to two sequences in that region. p53-DNA binding was completely abolished by excess unlabeled probe but not by nonspecific DNA and was super-shifted by the addition of an anti-p53 antibody. Taken together, our data strongly suggest that wild-type p53 represses GLUT1 and GLUT4 gene transcription in a tissue-specific manner. Mutations within the DNA-binding domain of p53, which are usually associated with malignancy, were found to impair the repressive effect of p53 on transcriptional activity of the GLUT1 and GLUT4 gene promoters, thereby resulting in increased glucose metabolism and cell energy supply. This, in turn, would be predicted to facilitate tumor growth.},

This review addresses in a comprehensive manner the main molecular events accounting for high-rate glycolysis in cancer. It starts from modulation of the Pasteur Effect allowing short-term adaptation to hypoxia, highlights the key role exerted by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 in long-term adaptation to hypoxia, and summarizes the current knowledge concerning the necessary involvement of aerobic glycolysis (the Warburg effect) in cancer cell proliferation. Based on the many observations positioning glycolysis as a central player in malignancy, the most advanced anticancer treatments targeting tumor glycolysis are briefly reviewed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell motility plays a central role in development, wound-healing and tumour invasion. Cultures of eukaryotic cells are a complex system where most cells move according to 'random' patterns, but may also be induced to a more coordinate migration by means of specific stimuli, such as the presence of chemical attractants or the introduction of a mechanical stimulus. Various tools have been developed that work by keeping track of the paths followed by specific objects and by performing statistical analysis on the recorded path data. The available tools include desktop applications or macros running within a commercial package, which address specific aspects of the process.

RESULTS: An online application, MotoCell, was developed to evaluate the motility of cell populations maintained in various experimental conditions. Statistical analysis of cell behaviour consists of the evaluation of descriptive parameters such as average speed and angle, directional persistence, path vector length, calculated for the whole population as well as for each cell and for each step of the migration; in this way the behaviour of a whole cell population may be assessed as a whole or as a sum of individual entities. The directional movement of objects may be studied by eliminating the modulo effect in circular statistics analysis, able to evaluate linear dispersion coefficient (R) and angular dispersion (S) values together with average angles. A case study is provided where the system is used to characterize motility of RasV12 transformed NIH3T3 fibroblasts.

CONCLUSION: Here we describe a comprehensive tool which takes care of all steps in cell motility analysis, including interactive cell tracking, path editing and statistical analysis of cell movement, all within a freely available online service. Although based on a standard web interface, the program is very fast and interactive and is immediately available to a large number of users, while exploiting the web approach in a very effective way. The ability to evaluate the behaviour of single cells allows to draw the attention on specific correlations, such as linearity of movement and deviation from the expected direction. In addition to population statistics, the analysis of single cells allows to group the cells into subpopulations, or even to evaluate the behaviour of each cell with respect to a variable reference, such as the direction of a wound or the position of the closest cell.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Rho GTPases (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 [Rac1] and cell division cycle 42 [Cdc42]) have been shown to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) via cytoskeletal remodelling, trafficking and fusion of insulin-secretory granules with the plasma membrane. GTP loading of these G proteins, which is facilitated by GDP/GTP exchange factors, is a requisite step in the regulation of downstream effector proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV2 (VAV2), a member of the Dbl family of proteins, has been identified as one of the GDP/GTP exchange factors for Rac1. Despite recent evidence on the regulatory roles of VAV2 in different cell types, roles of this guanine nucleotide exchange factor in the signalling events leading to GSIS remain undefined. Using immunological, short interfering RNA (siRNA), pharmacological and microscopic approaches we investigated the role of VAV2 in GSIS from islet beta cells.

METHODS: Co-localisation of Rac1 and VAV2 was determined by Triton X-114 phase partition and confocal microscopy. Glucose-induced actin remodelling was quantified by live cell imaging using the LifeAct-GFP fluorescent biosensor. Rac1 activation was determined by G protein linked immunosorbent assay (G-LISA).

RESULTS: Western blotting indicated that VAV2 is expressed in INS-1 832/13 beta cells, normal rat islets and human islets. Vav2 siRNA markedly attenuated GSIS in INS-1 832/13 cells. Ehop-016, a newly discovered small molecule inhibitor of the VAV2-Rac1 interaction, or siRNA-mediated knockdown of VAV2 markedly attenuated glucose-induced Rac1 activation and GSIS in INS-1 832/13 cells. Pharmacological findings were recapitulated in primary rat islets. A high glucose concentration promoted co-localisation of Rac1 and VAV2. Real-time imaging in live cells indicated a significant inhibition of glucose-induced cortical actin remodelling by Ehop-016.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data provide the first evidence to implicate VAV2 in glucose-induced Rac1 activation, actin remodelling and GSIS in pancreatic beta cells.},

abstract = {While the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) is fundamental to insulin-regulated glucose metabolism, its dynamic spatial organization in the plasma membrane (PM) is unclear. Here, using multicolor TIRF microscopy in transfected adipose cells, we demonstrate that insulin regulates not only the exocytosis of GLUT4 storage vesicles but also PM distribution of GLUT4 itself. In the basal state, domains (clusters) of GLUT4 molecules in PM are created by an exocytosis that retains GLUT4 at the fusion site. Surprisingly, when insulin induces a burst of GLUT4 exocytosis, it does not merely accelerate this basal exocytosis but rather stimulates approximately 60-fold another mode of exocytosis that disperses GLUT4 into PM. In contradistinction, internalization of most GLUT4, regardless of insulin, occurs from pre-existing clusters via the subsequent recruitment of clathrin. The data fit a new kinetic model that features multifunctional clusters as intermediates of exocytosis and endocytosis.},

It mainly occurs in Central and Southeast Asia, and is closely related to the practice of tobacco smoking and betel squid chewing. The high recurrence and low survival rates of buccal SCC require our continued efforts to understand the pathogenesis of the disease for designing better therapeutic strategies. We used proteomic technology to analyze buccal SCC tissues aiming at identifying tumor-associated proteins for the utilization as biomarkers or molecular targets. With the exception of alpha B-crystallin being substantially reduced, a number of proteins were found to be significantly over-expressed in cancer tissues. These increased proteins included glycolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, tumor antigens, cytoskeleton proteins, enzymes involved in detoxification and anti-oxidation systems, and proteins involved in mitochondrial and intracellular signaling pathways. These extensive protein variations indicate that multiple cellular pathways were involved in the process of tumorigenesis, and suggest that multiple protein molecules should be simultaneously targeted as an effective strategy to counter the disease. At least, SCC antigen, G protein, glutathione S-transferase, manganese superoxide dismutase, annexins, voltage-dependent anion channel, cyclophilin A, stratifin and galectin 7 are candidates for targeted proteins. The present findings also demonstrated that rich protein information can be produced by means of proteomic analysis for a better understanding of the oncogenesis and pathogenesis in a global way, which in turn is a basis for the rational designs of diagnostic and therapeutic methods.},

Confocal scanning was performed at 488-nm illumination for excitation of exogenously applied fluorophores (topical acriflavine and intravenous fluorescein). Confocal endomicroscopy allowed for visualization of cellular and subcellular structures of the anterior human oropharyngeal region. Fluorescein staining yielded architectural details of the surface epithelium and also subepithelial layers. Images taken at increasing depth beneath the epithelium showed the mucosal capillary network. Acriflavine strongly contrasted the cell nuclei of the surface epithelium. The findings correlated well with the histology of biopsy specimens. This is the first report showing that the use of fluorescence confocal endomicroscopy represents a promising method to examine cellular details in vivo in different oropharyngeal regions in human.},

abstract = {Only humans and higher primates have high uric acid blood levels. Although high uric acid causes gout, it has been linked with human longevity because of its hypothetical antioxidant function. Recent studies reveal that p53 has significant roles in cellular metabolism. One example of this is an antioxidant function that potentially contributes to tumor suppression. Here, we reported a first beneficial link between p53 and uric acid. We identified the uric acid transporter SLC2A9 (also known as GLUT9) as a direct p53 target gene and a key downstream effector in the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through transporting uric acid as a source of antioxidant. Oxidative stress induced SLC2A9 expression in a p53-dependent manner, and inhibition of SLC2A9 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or anti-gout drugs such as probenecid significantly increased ROS levels in an uric acid-dependent manner and greatly sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Conversely, expression of SLC2A9 reduced ROS and protected against DNA damage and cell death, suggesting its antioxidant function. The increased production of ROS because of p53 loss was rescued by SLC2A9 expression. Furthermore, decreased SLC2A9 expression was observed in several cancer types and was associated with a poorer prognosis. Our findings suggest that the p53-SLC2A9 pathway is a novel antioxidant mechanism that uses uric acid to maintain ROS homeostasis and prevent accumulation of ROS-associated damage that potentially contributes to cancer development.Oncogene advance online publication, 26 May 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.119.},

abstract = {The retinoic-acid-inducible gene (RIG)-like receptor (RLR) family proteins are major pathogen reorganization receptors (PRR) responsible for detection of viral RNA, which initiates antiviral response. Here, we evaluated the functional role of one RLR family member, RIG-I, in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). RIG-I is abundantly expressed both in poorly-differentiated primary cancer and lymph node metastasis, but not in normal adjacent tissues. Activation of RIG-I by transfection with low dose of 5'-triphosphate RNA (3p-RNA) induces low levels of interferon and proinflammatory cytokines and promotes NF-$\kappa$B- and Akt-dependent cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In contrast, activation of RIG-I by a high dose of 3p-RNA induces robust mitochondria-derived apoptosis accompanied by decreased activation of Akt, which is independent of the interferon and TNF$\alpha$ receptor, but can be rescued by over-expression of constitutively active Akt. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the CARD domain of RIG-I is essential for inducing apoptosis by interacting with caspase-9. Together, our results reveal a dual role of RIG-I in HNSCC through regulating activation of Akt, in which RIG-I activation by low-dose viral dsRNA increases host cell survival, whereas higher level of RIG-I activation leads to apoptosis. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of dsRNA mediated RIG-I activation in the treatment of HNSCC.},

abstract = {CD44 is a complex family of molecules, associated with aggressive malignancies and cancer stem cells. However, the role of CD44 variants in tumor progression and treatment resistance is not clear. In this study, the expression of CD44 and its variants was assessed in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Furthermore, subpopulations of cells expressing high amounts of CD44 variants were identified and characterized, for e.g., cell cycle phase and radioresistance. Results revealed high and homogenous CD44 and CD44v7 expression in four cell lines and CD44v4 and CD44v6 in three cell lines. CD44v3 was highly expressed in two cell lines, whereas CD44v5, CD44v7/8, CD44v10, CD133, and CD24 demonstrated no or moderate expression. Moreover, a subpopulation of very high CD44v4 expression was identified, which is independent of cell phase, demonstrating increased proliferation and radioresistance. In cell starvation experiments designed to enrich for cancer stem cells, a large population with dramatically increased expression of CD44, CD44v3, CD44v6, and CD44v7 was formed. Expression was independent of cell phase, and cells demonstrated increased radioresistance and migration rate. Our results demonstrate that the heterogeneity of tumor cells has important clinical implications for the treatment of HNSCC and that some of the CD44 variants may be associated with increased radioresistance. Highly expressed CD44 variants could make interesting candidates for selective cancer targeting.},

Proteins that are expressed at a particular cell state or in a particular compartment as well as proteins with differential expression between various cells states are commonly delivered by many proteomics studies. Once a list of proteins is derived, a major challenge is to interpret the identified set of proteins in the biological context. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) data represents abundant information that can be employed for this purpose. However, these data have not yet been fully exploited due to the absence of a methodological framework that can integrate this type of information. Here, we propose to infer a network model from an experimentally identified protein list based on the available information about the topology of the global PPI network. We propose to use a Monte Carlo simulation procedure to compute the statistical significance of the inferred models. The method has been implemented as a freely available web-based tool, PPI spider (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/proj/ppispider). To support the practical significance of PPI spider, we collected several hundreds of recently published experimental proteomics studies that reported lists of proteins in various biological contexts. We reanalyzed them using PPI spider and demonstrated that in most cases PPI spider could provide statistically significant hypotheses that are helpful for understanding of the protein list.},

abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetes treatments were related with either an increased or reduced risk of cancer. There is ongoing debate about a potential protective action of metformin. To summarize evidence on the association between metformin and risk of cancer and cancer mortality in patients with diabetes.

METHODS: Data source: MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1966-April 2012). We selected randomized studies comparing metformin and other hypoglycaemic agents and observational studies exploring the association between exposure to metformin and cancer. Outcomes were cancer mortality, all malignancies and site-specific cancers.

RESULTS: Of 25307 citations identified, 12 randomized controlled trials (21,595 patients) and 41 observational studies (1,029,389 patients) met the inclusion criteria. In observational studies there was a significant association of exposure to metformin with the risk of cancer death [6 studies, 24,410 patients, OR:0.65, 95{\%}CI: 0.53-0.80], all malignancies [18 studies, 561,836 patients, OR:0.73, 95{\%}CI: 0.61-0.88], liver [8 studies, 312,742 patients, OR:0.34; 95{\%}CI: 0.19-0.60] colorectal [12 studies, 871,365 patients, OR:0.83, 95{\%}CI: 0.74-0.92], pancreas [9 studies, 847,248 patients, OR:0.56, 95{\%}CI: 0.36-0.86], stomach [2 studies, 100701 patients, OR:0.83, 95{\%}CI: 0.76-0.91], and esophagus cancer [2 studies, 100694 patients, OR:0.90, 95{\%}CI: 0.83-0.98]. No significant difference of risk was observed in randomized trials. Metformin was not associated with the risk of: breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, uterus cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, and melanoma.

CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Results suggest that Metformin might be associated with a significant reduction in the risk of cancer and cancer-related mortality. Randomized trials specifically designed to evaluate the efficacy of metformin as an anticancer agent are warranted.

abstract = {Malaria-infected red blood cells (iRBCs) become less deformable with the progression of infection and tend to occlude microcapillaries. This process has been investigated in vitro using microfluidic channels. The objective of this paper is to provide a quantitative basis for interpreting the experimental observations of iRBC occlusion of microfluidic channels. Using a particle-based model for the iRBC, we simulate the traverse of iRBCs through a converging microfluidic channel and explore the progressive loss of cell deformability due to three factors: the stiffening of the membrane, the reduction of the cell's surface-volume ratio, and the growing solid parasites inside the cell. When examined individually, each factor tends to hinder the passage of the iRBC and lengthen the transit time. Moreover, at sufficient magnitude, each may lead to obstruction of narrow microfluidic channels. We then integrate the three factors into a series of simulations that mimic the development of malaria infection through the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages. These simulations successfully reproduce the experimental observation that with progression of infection, the iRBC transitions from passage to blockage in larger and larger channels. The numerical results suggest a scheme for quantifying iRBC rigidification through microfluidic measurements of the critical pressure required for passage.},

The increasing amount of genomic information on human tumors and cell lines provides more biological data to design preclinical studies. We and others previously reported whole exome sequencing data of 106 HNSCC primary tumors. In 2012, high throughput genomic data and pharmacological profiling of anticancer drugs of hundreds of cancer cell lines were reported. Here we compared the genomic data of 39 HNSCC cell lines with the genomic findings in 106 HNSCC tumors. Amplification of eight genes (PIK3CA, EGFR, CCND2, KDM5A, ERBB2, PMS1, FGFR1 and WHSCIL1) and deletion of five genes (CDKN2A, SMAD4, NOTCH2, NRAS and TRIM33) were found in both HNSCC cell lines and tumors. Seventeen genes were only mutated in HNSCC cell lines ({\textgreater}10{\%}) suggesting that these mutations may arise through immortalization in tissue culture. Conversely, 11 genes were only mutated in {\textgreater}10{\%} of human HNSCC tumors. Several mutant genes in the EGFR pathway are shared both in cell lines and in tumors. Pharmacological profiling of eight anticancer agents in six HNSCC cell lines suggested that PIK3CA mutation may serve as a predictive biomarker for the drugs targeting the EGFR/PI3K pathway. These findings suggest that a correlation of gene mutations between HNSCC cell lines and human tumors may be used to guide the selection of preclinical models for translational research. Implications: Findings provide novel insight on preclinical model selection for mutation-driven head and neck cancer studies.},

Two weeks after the second DC injection, systemic immunological reactions and tumor size were measured. The DC-treated group showed a significant reduction in tumor size compared with the control. Although the induction of CTL activity in spleen cells was marginal, Th1 cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon-$\gamma$ were elevated in the DC-treated group.

abstract = {AIMS: Expression of extracellular matrix protein CCN1 is induced in end-stage ischaemic cardiomyopathy in humans, and after cardiac ischaemia and reperfusion in experimental animal models. Despite its well-documented angiogenic activities, CCN1 increases the cytotoxicities of the tumour necrosis factor family cytokines, which promotes apoptosis in fibroblasts. We aimed to determine the physiological function of CCN1 in an injured heart. METHODS AND RESULTS: To assess the function of CCN1 in vivo, knock-in mice carrying the apoptosis-defective mutant allele Ccn1-dm were tested in an isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial injury model (100 mg/kg/day of sc injected ISO for 5 days). Compared with wild-type mice, Ccn1(dm/dm) mice were remarkably resistant to ISO-induced cardiac injury; they showed no post-treatment cardiomyocyte apoptosis or myocardial tissue damage. ISO cardiotoxicity was dependent on Fas ligand (FasL) and its downstream signalling. Using primary cultures of cardiomyocytes isolated from rats, we demonstrated that CCN1 sensitized FasL-mediated apoptosis by engaging its cell-surface receptor integrin $\alpha$6$\beta$1 and up-regulating intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activated mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, and increased cell-surface Fas expression. CONCLUSION: CCN1 is a critical pathophysiological regulator that mediates cardiomyocyte apoptosis during work-overload-induced cardiac injury. CCN1 increases cellular susceptibility to Fas-induced apoptosis by increasing ROS and cell-surface Fas expression.},

abstract = {Metabolic control analysis of tumor glycolysis has indicated that hexokinase (HK) and glucose transporter (GLUT) exert the main flux control (71{\%}). To understand why they are the main controlling steps, the GLUT and HK kinetics and the contents of GLUT1, GLUT2, GLUT3, GLUT4, HKI, and HKII were analyzed in rat hepatocarcinoma AS-30D and HeLa human cervix cancer. An improved protocol to determine the kinetic parameters of GLUT was developed with D-[2-(3)H-glucose] as physiological substrate. Kinetic analysis revealed two components at low- and high-glucose concentrations in both tumor cells. At low glucose and 37 degrees C, the V(max) was 55 +/- 20 and 17.2 +/- 6 nmol (min x mg protein)(-1), whereas the K(m) was 0.52 +/- 0.7 and 9.3 +/- 3 mM for hepatoma and HeLa cells, respectively. GLUT activity was partially inhibited by cytochalasin B (IC(50) = 0.44 +/- 0.1; K(i) = 0.3 +/- 0.1 microM) and phloretin (IC(50) = 8.7 microM) in AS-30D hepatocarcinoma. At physiological glucose, GLUT1 and GLUT3 were the predominant active isoforms in HeLa cells and AS-30D cells, respectively. HK activity in HeLa cells was much lower (60 mU/mg protein) than that in AS-30D cells (700 mU/mg protein), but both HKs were strongly inhibited by G6P. HKII was the predominant isoform in AS-30D carcinoma and HeLa cells. The much lower GLUT V(max) and catalytic efficiency (V(max)/K(m)) values in comparison to those of G6P-sensitive HK suggested the transporter exerts higher control on the glycolytic flux than HK in cancer cells. Thus, GLUT seems a more adequate therapeutic target.},

abstract = {Cancer cells frequently display high rates of aerobic glycolysis in comparison to their nontransformed counterparts, although the molecular basis of this phenomenon remains poorly understood. Constitutive activity of the serine/threonine kinase Akt is a common perturbation observed in malignant cells. Surprisingly, although Akt activity is sufficient to promote leukemogenesis in nontransformed hematopoietic precursors and maintenance of Akt activity was required for rapid disease progression, the expression of activated Akt did not increase the proliferation of the premalignant or malignant cells in culture. However, Akt stimulated glucose consumption in transformed cells without affecting the rate of oxidative phosphorylation. High rates of aerobic glycolysis were also identified in human glioblastoma cells possessing but not those lacking constitutive Akt activity. Akt-expressing cells were more susceptible than control cells to death after glucose withdrawal. These data suggest that activation of the Akt oncogene is sufficient to stimulate the switch to aerobic glycolysis characteristic of cancer cells and that Akt activity renders cancer cells dependent on aerobic glycolysis for continued growth and survival.},

Similarly, the constitutive activation of signaling cascades that stimulate cell growth has a profound impact on anabolic metabolism.

abstract = {The goal of the present work was to evaluate the correlation of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) and carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) with the monocarboxylate transporters 1 (MCT1) and 4 (MCT4) and their chaperone, CD147, in breast cancer. The clinico-pathological value of GLUT1 and CAIX was also evaluated. For that, we analysed the immunohistochemical expression of GLUT1 and CAIX, in a large series of invasive breast carcinoma samples (n=124), previously characterized for MCT1, MCT4 and CD147 expression. GLUT1 expression was found in 46{\%} of the cases (57/124), while CAIX was found in 18{\%} of the cases (22/122). Importantly, both MCT1 and CD147, but not MCT4, were associated with GLUT1 and CAIX expression. Also, GLUT1 and CAIX correlated with each other. Concerning the clinico-pathological values, GLUT1 was associated with high grade tumours, basal-like subtype, absence of progesterone receptor, presence of vimentin and high proliferative index as measured by Ki-67. Additionally, CAIX was associated with large tumour size, high histological grade, basal-like subtype, absence of estrogen and progesterone receptors and presence of basal cytokeratins and vimentin expression. Finally, patients with CAIX positive tumours had a significantly shorter disease-free survival. The association between MCT1 and both GLUT1 and CAIX may result from hypoxia-mediated metabolic adaptations, which confer a glycolytic, acid-resistant and more aggressive phenotype to cancer cells.},

abstract = {Acute intensive insulin therapy causes a transient worsening of diabetic retinopathy in type 1 diabetes patients and is related to VEGF expression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to be involved in HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression induced by insulin, but the role of specific ROS sources has not been fully elucidated. In this study we examined the role of NADPH oxidase subunit 4 (Nox4) in insulin-stimulated HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression, and angiogenic responses in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECs). Here we demonstrate that knockdown of Nox4 by siRNA reduced insulin-stimulated ROS generation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of IR-$\beta$ and IRS-1, but did not change the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1. Nox4 gene silencing had a much greater inhibitory effect on insulin-induced AKT activation than ERK1/2 activation, whereas it had little effect on the expression of the phosphatases such as MKP-1 and SHIP. Inhibition of Nox4 expression inhibited the transcriptional activity of VEGF through HIF-1. Overexpression of wild-type Nox4 was sufficient to increase VEGF transcriptional activity, and further enhanced insulin-stimulated the activation of VEGF. Downregulation of Nox4 expression decreased insulin-stimulated mRNA and protein expression of HIF-1$\alpha$, but did not change the rate of HIF-1$\alpha$ degradation. Inhibition of Nox4 impaired insulin-stimulated VEGF expression, cell migration, cell proliferation, and tube formation in HMVECs. Our data indicate that Nox4-derived ROS are essential for HIF-1$\alpha$-dependent VEGF expression, and angiogenesis in vitro induced by insulin. Nox4 may be an attractive therapeutic target for diabetic retinopathy caused by intensive insulin treatment.},

Targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is attractive in that it is an early critical event in HNSCC pathogenesis. However, current agents lack efficacy or have unacceptable toxicity. Several groups have demonstrated that the over-the-counter medication, polyethylene glycol (PEG) has remarkable chemopreventive efficacy against colon carcinogenesis. Importantly, we reported that this effect is mediated through EGFR internalization/degradation. In the current study, we investigated the chemopreventive efficacy of this agent against HNSCC, using both the well validated animal model 4-NQO (4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide) rat model and cell culture with the human HNSCC cell line SCC-25. We demonstrated that daily topical application of 10{\%} PEG-8000 in the oral cavity (tongue and cavity wall) post 4NQO initiation resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden (both, tumor size and tumors/tumor bearing rat) without any evidence of toxicity. Immunohistochemical studies depicted decreased proliferation (number of Ki67-positive cells) and reduced expression of EGFR and its downstream effectors cyclin D1 in the tongue mucosa of 4NQO-rats treated with PEG. We showed that EGFR was also markedly downregulated in SCC-25 cells by PEG-8000 with a concomitant induction of G1-S phase cell-cycle arrest, which was potentially mediated through upregulated p21(cip1/waf1). In conclusion, we demonstrate, for the first time, that PEG has promising efficacy and safety as a chemopreventive efficacy against oral carcinogenesis.},

abstract = {Proliferating cells, including cancer cells, require altered metabolism to efficiently incorporate nutrients such as glucose into biomass. The M2 isoform of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) promotes the metabolism of glucose by aerobic glycolysis and contributes to anabolic metabolism. Paradoxically, decreased pyruvate kinase enzyme activity accompanies the expression of PKM2 in rapidly dividing cancer cells and tissues. We demonstrate that phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), the substrate for pyruvate kinase in cells, can act as a phosphate donor in mammalian cells because PEP participates in the phosphorylation of the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM1) in PKM2-expressing cells. We used mass spectrometry to show that the phosphate from PEP is transferred to the catalytic histidine (His11) on human PGAM1. This reaction occurred at physiological concentrations of PEP and produced pyruvate in the absence of PKM2 activity. The presence of histidine-phosphorylated PGAM1 correlated with the expression of PKM2 in cancer cell lines and tumor tissues. Thus, decreased pyruvate kinase activity in PKM2-expressing cells allows PEP-dependent histidine phosphorylation of PGAM1 and may provide an alternate glycolytic pathway that decouples adenosine triphosphate production from PEP-mediated phosphotransfer, allowing for the high rate of glycolysis to support the anabolic metabolism observed in many proliferating cells.},

abstract = {The ability to design and engineer organisms demands the ability to predict kinetic responses of novel regulatory networks built from well-characterized biological components. Surprisingly, few validated kinetic models of complex regulatory networks have been derived by combining models of the network components. A major bottleneck in producing such models is the difficulty of measuring in vivo rate constants for components of complex networks. We demonstrate that a simple, genetic approach to measuring rate constants in vivo produces an accurate kinetic model of the complex network that Saccharomyces cerevisiae employs to regulate the expression of genes encoding glucose transporters. The model predicts a transient pulse of transcription of HXT4 (but not HXT2 or HXT3) in response to addition of a small amount of glucose to cells, an outcome we observed experimentally. Our model also provides a mechanistic explanation for this result: HXT2-4 are governed by a type 2, incoherent feed forward regulatory loop involving the Rgt1 and Mig2 transcriptional repressors. The efficiency with which Rgt1 and Mig2 repress expression of each HXT gene determines which of them have a pulse of transcription in response to glucose. Finally, the model correctly predicts how lesions in the feed forward loop change the kinetics of induction of HXT4 expression.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Chronic inflammation plays a fundamental role in tumor promotion, migration, and invasion. With the use of microarray profiling, a profound increase was observed for those transcripts involved in proinflammatory signaling in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor-treated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells as compared with their respective controls. As such, it was hypothesized that EGFR inhibitor efficacy is offset by the proinflammatory response that these therapeutics conjure in HNSCC. Systematic evaluation of the clinical EGFR inhibitors-erlotinib, cetuximab, lapatinib, and panitumumab-revealed increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, TNF-$\alpha$, and IFN-$\gamma$. Mechanistic focus on IL-6 revealed that erlotinib induced a time-dependent increase in IL-6 mRNA and protein expression. Importantly, exogenous IL-6 protected HNSCC cells from erlotinib-induced cytotoxicity, whereas tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor antagonist, sensitized cells to erlotinib in vitro and in vivo. Inhibitors of NF-$\kappa$B, p38, and JNK suppressed erlotinib-induced IL-6 expression, suggesting critical roles for NF-$\kappa$B and MAPK in IL-6 regulation. Furthermore, knockdown of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) suppressed erlotinib-induced proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, these results demonstrate that clinical EGFR inhibitors induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines via NOX4.

IMPLICATIONS: The antitumor activity of EGFR inhibitors is reduced by activation of NOX4-mediated proinflammatory pathways in HNSCC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thermococcus gammatolerans was isolated from samples collected from hydrothermal chimneys. It is one of the most radioresistant organisms known amongst the Archaea. We report the determination and annotation of its complete genome sequence, its comparison with other Thermococcales genomes, and a proteomic analysis.

RESULTS: T. gammatolerans has a circular chromosome of 2.045 Mbp without any extra-chromosomal elements, coding for 2,157 proteins. A thorough comparative genomics analysis revealed important but unsuspected genome plasticity differences between sequenced Thermococcus and Pyrococcus species that could not be attributed to the presence of specific mobile elements. Two virus-related regions, tgv1 and tgv2, are the only mobile elements identified in this genome. A proteogenome analysis was performed by a shotgun liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry approach, allowing the identification of 10,931 unique peptides corresponding to 951 proteins. This information concurrently validates the accuracy of the genome annotation. Semi-quantification of proteins by spectral count was done on exponential- and stationary-phase cells. Insights into general catabolism, hydrogenase complexes, detoxification systems, and the DNA repair toolbox of this archaeon are revealed through this genome and proteome analysis.

CONCLUSIONS: This work is the first archaeal proteome investigation done at the stage of primary genome annotation. This archaeon is shown to use a large variety of metabolic pathways even under a rich medium growth condition. This proteogenomic study also indicates that the high radiotolerance of T. gammatolerans is probably due to proteins that remain to be characterized rather than a larger arsenal of known DNA repair enzymes.},

RSV-stimulated glucose uptake was abolished by AMPK inhibition. In the presence of the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide, RSV-stimulated 2DG uptake and AMPK phosphorylation were abolished. RSV did not stimulate significant translocation of GLUT4 or GLUT1 transporters. However, treatment with indinavir, a GLUT4 specific inhibitor, blocked RSV-stimulated glucose uptake. We propose that RSV elevates glucose uptake in muscle cells through a mechanism that involves sirtuins and AMPK and possibly stimulation of GLUT4 transporter intrinsic activity.},

abstract = {Insulin stimulates glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissues through glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4). GLUT4 cycles between the intracellular compartments and the plasma membrane. GLUT4 traffic-regulating insulin signals are largely within the insulin receptor-insulin receptor substrate-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (IR-IRS-PI3K) axis. In muscle cells, insulin signal bifurcates downstream of the PI3K into one arm leading to the activation of the Ser/Thr kinases Akt and atypical protein kinase C, and another leading to the activation of Rho family protein Rac1 leading to actin remodelling. Activated Akt inactivates AS160, a GTPase-activating protein for Rab family small G proteins. Here we review the roles of Rab and Rho proteins, particularly Rab substrates of AS160 and Rac1, in insulin-stimulated GLUT4 traffic. We discuss: (1) how distinct steps in GLUT4 traffic may be regulated by discrete Rab proteins, and (2) the importance of Rac1 activation in insulin-induced actin remodelling in muscle cells, a key element for the net gain in surface GLUT4.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

abstract = {Like many epithelial tumors, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) contains a heterogeneous population of cancer cells. We developed an immunodeficient mouse model to test the tumorigenic potential of different populations of cancer cells derived from primary, unmanipulated human HNSCC samples. We show that a minority population of CD44(+) cancer cells, which typically comprise {\textless}10{\%} of the cells in a HNSCC tumor, but not the CD44(-) cancer cells, gave rise to new tumors in vivo. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the CD44(+) cancer cells have a primitive cellular morphology and costain with the basal cell marker Cytokeratin 5/14, whereas the CD44(-) cancer cells resemble differentiated squamous epithelium and express the differentiation marker Involucrin. The tumors that arose from purified CD44(+) cells reproduced the original tumor heterogeneity and could be serially passaged, thus demonstrating the two defining properties of stem cells: ability to self-renew and to differentiate. Furthermore, the tumorigenic CD44(+) cells differentially express the BMI1 gene, at both the RNA and protein levels. By immunohistochemical analysis, the CD44(+) cells in the tumor express high levels of nuclear BMI1, and are arrayed in characteristic tumor microdomains. BMI1 has been demonstrated to play a role in self-renewal in other stem cell types and to be involved in tumorigenesis. Taken together, these data demonstrate that cells within the CD44(+) population of human HNSCC possess the unique properties of cancer stem cells in functional assays for cancer stem cell self-renewal and differentiation and form unique histological microdomains that may aid in cancer diagnosis.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are molecules or ions formed by the incomplete one-electron reduction of oxygen. Of interest, it seems that ROS manifest dual roles, cancer promoting or cancer suppressing, in tumorigenesis. ROS participate simultaneously in two signaling pathways that have inverse functions in tumorigenesis, Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. It is well known that Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signaling is related to oncogenesis, while the p38 MAPK pathway contributes to cancer suppression, which involves oncogene-induced senescence, inflammation-induced cellular senescence, replicative senescence, contact inhibition and DNA-damage responses. Thus, ROS may not be an absolute carcinogenic factor or cancer suppressor. The purpose of the present review is to discuss the dual roles of ROS in the pathogenesis of cancer, and the signaling pathway mediating their role in tumorigenesis.},

Here, we reveal that a high-fat diet (HFD) generates a profound reorganization of specific metabolic pathways, leading to widespread remodeling of the liver clock. Strikingly, in addition to disrupting the normal circadian cycle, HFD causes an unexpectedly large-scale genesis of de novo oscillating transcripts, resulting in reorganization of the coordinated oscillations between coherent transcripts and metabolites. The mechanisms underlying this reprogramming involve both the impairment of CLOCK:BMAL1 chromatin recruitment and a pronounced cyclic activation of surrogate pathways through the transcriptional regulator PPAR$\gamma$. Finally, we demonstrate that it is specifically the nutritional challenge, and not the development of obesity, that causes the reprogramming of the clock and that the effects of the diet on the clock are reversible.},

Citreoviridin, an ATP synthase inhibitor, selectively suppresses the proliferation and growth of lung cancer without affecting normal cells. However, the global effects of targeting ectopic ATP synthase in vivo have not been well defined. In this study, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and provided a comprehensive insight into the complicated regulation by citreoviridin in a lung cancer xenograft model. With high reproducibility of the quantitation, we obtained quantitative proteomic profiling with 2,659 proteins identified. Bioinformatics analysis of the 141 differentially expressed proteins selected by their relative abundance revealed that citreoviridin induces alterations in the expression of glucose metabolism-related enzymes in lung cancer. The up-regulation of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and storage of glucose indicated that citreoviridin may reduce the glycolytic intermediates for macromolecule synthesis and inhibit cell proliferation. Using comprehensive proteomics, the results identify metabolic aspects that help explain the antitumorigenic effect of citreoviridin in lung cancer, which may lead to a better understanding of the links between metabolism and tumorigenesis in cancer therapy.},

Tracking GLUT4 in space and time can provide new insights for understanding the mechanisms of insulin-regulated GLUT4 translocation. Organic dyes and fluorescent proteins were used in previous studies for investigating the traffic of GLUT4 in skeletal muscle cells and adipocytes. Because of their relative weak fluorescent signal against strong cellular autofluorescence background and their fast photobleaching rate, most studies only focused on particular segments of GLUT4 traffic. In this study, we have developed a new method for observing the translocation of GLUT4 targeted with photostable and bright quantum dots (QDs) in live L6 cells. QDs were targeted to GLUT4myc specifically and internalized with GLUT4myc through receptor-mediated endocytosis. Compared with traditional fluorescence dyes and fluorescent proteins, QDs with high brightness and extremely photostability are suitable for long-term single particle tracking, so individual GLUT4-QD complex can be easily detected and tracked for long periods of time. This newly described method will be a powerful tool for observing the translocation of GLUT4 in live L6 cells.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Hypoxia shifts the balance of cellular energy production toward glycolysis with lactate generation as a by-product. Quantitative bioluminescence imaging allows for the quantitation of lactate concentrations in individual tumors. We assessed the relationship between pretreatment tumor lactate concentrations and subsequent development of metastatic disease in patients with newly diagnosed head-and-neck cancer.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: At the time of biopsy of the primary site, a separate specimen was taken and flash-frozen for subsequent quantitation of lactate concentration using a luciferase bioluminescence technique. The two-dimensional spatial distribution of the bioluminescence intensity within the tissue section was registered directly using a microscope and an imaging photon counting system. Photon intensity was converted to distributions of volume-related tissue concentrations (micromol per gram wet weight). Treatment consisted of either surgery and postoperative radiotherapy or primary radiotherapy, based on presenting disease stage and institutional treatment policies. The subsequent development of metastatic disease constituted the primary clinical endpoint.

RESULTS: Biopsies obtained from 40 patients were evaluable in 34. The larynx was the most frequent primary site (n = 25). Other sites included oropharynx (n = 5), hypopharynx (n = 3), and oral cavity (n = 1). Most patients (74{\%}) presented with an advanced stage T3 or T4 primary tumor. Nodal involvement was present in 19 (54{\%}) patients. The median tumor lactate concentration was 7.1 micromol/g. Tumors were classified as having either low or high lactate concentrations according to whether these values were below or above the median. The median follow-up time for surviving patients is 27 months. Two-year actuarial survival was 90{\%} for patients with low-lactate-concentration tumor vs. 35{\%} for patients with high-lactate-concentration primaries ({\textless}0.0001). Two-year metastasis-free survival was adversely influenced by high tumor lactate concentrations (90{\%} vs. 25{\%}, p {\textless} 0.0001). The median lactate concentration for tumors that subsequently metastasized was 12.9 micromol/g vs. 4.8 micromol/g for patients who remained continuously free of disease (p {\textless} 0.005). Lactate concentration was not correlated with presenting T stage or N stage.

DISCUSSION: Elevated tumor lactate concentrations are associated with the subsequent development of nodal or distant metastases in head-and-neck cancer patients. This more aggressive malignant phenotype is probably associated with hypoxia-mediated radioresistance and the upregulation of metastasis-associated genes.},

The significance of these metabolic changes to ATP production remains however ill defined. Here, we integrate LC-MS-based isotope tracer studies with oxygen uptake measurements in a quantitative redox-balanced metabolic flux model of mammalian cellular metabolism. We then apply this approach to assess the impact of Ras and Akt activation and hypoxia on energy metabolism. Both oncogene activation and hypoxia induce roughly a twofold increase in glycolytic flux. Ras activation and hypoxia also strongly decrease glucose oxidation. Oxidative phosphorylation, powered substantially by glutamine-driven TCA turning, however, persists and accounts for the majority of ATP production. Consistent with this, in all cases, pharmacological inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation markedly reduces energy charge, and glutamine but not glucose removal markedly lowers oxygen uptake. Thus, glutamine-driven oxidative phosphorylation is a major means of ATP production even in hypoxic cancer cells.},

abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinomas are among the 10 most common cancers and have a 50{\%} lethality rate after 5 years. Despite easy access to the oral cavity for cancer screening, the main limitations to successful treatment are uncertain prognostic criteria for (pre-)malignant lesions. Identifying a functional cellular marker may represent a significant improvement for diagnosis and treatment. Toward this goal, mechanical phenotyping of individual cells is a novel approach to detect cytoskeletal changes, which are diagnostic for malignant change. The compliance of cells from cell lines and primary samples of healthy donors and cancer patients was measured using a microfluidic optical stretcher. Cancer cells showed significantly different mechanical behavior, with a higher mean deformability and increased variance. Cancer cells (n approximately 30 cells measured from each patient) were on average 3.5 times more compliant than those of healthy donors [D(normal) = (4.43 +/- 0.68) 10(-3) Pa(-1); D(cancer) = (15.8 +/- 1.5) 10(-3) Pa(-1); P {\textless} 0.01]. The diagnosis results of the patient samples were confirmed by standard histopathology. The generality of these findings was supported by measurements of two normal and four cancer oral epithelial cell lines. Our results indicate that mechanical phenotyping is a sensible, label-free approach for classifying cancer cells to enable broad screening of suspicious lesions in the oral cavity. It could in principle be applied to any cancer to aid conventional diagnostic procedures.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the apoptosis-inducing effect of gambogic acid (GA) on Jurkat cells and its underlying signaling pathway. Apoptosis induced by GA and some inhibitors was assayed by Annexin V/PI doubling staining. The levels of caspase 3, caspase 8 and caspase 9 activated in living Jurkat cells were measured by flow cytometry. The expressions of caspase 3, caspase 9, p-JNK and P38 were detected by Western blot. The results showed that GA induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. The positive cell number of activated caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9 and the levels of activated caspase 3, caspase 9, p-JNK, P38 increased after Jurkat cells were treated with GA. ROS, CaMKII, caspase 3, caspase 9, MAPKK, JNK1/2 and P38 inhibitors had some significant effect on GA-induced apoptosis. ROS, CaMKII, MAPKK, JNK1/2 and P38 inhibitors decreased the levels of activated caspase 3, caspase 9 by GA.ROS, CaMKII, MAPKK, JNK1/2 inhibitors decreased the levels of p-JNK by GA. ROS, CaMKII, MAPKK, P38 inhibitors decreased the levels of P38 by GA. It is concluded that GA induced apoptosis of Jurkat cells by activated caspases through activating of ROS-CaMKII-MAPKK-JNK/P38 pathway.},

abstract = {Glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and PI3K/Akt are known to be closely involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Co-targeted therapy reducing GLUT-1 expression and PI3K/Akt pathway activity may overcome the chemoresistance of human cancers. Apigenin may inhibit the expression of GLUT-1 and the PI3K/Akt pathway. We hypothesized that over-expression of GLUT-1 and p-Akt was associated with the resistance to cisplatin of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells. We explored whether apigenin inhibited GLUT-1 and p-Akt, resulting in sensitization of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells to cisplatin. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed the presence of GLUT-1 mRNA, and GLUT-1 and p-Akt proteins in Hep-2 cells. We found that resistance or insensitivity of Hep-2 cells to cisplatin might be associated with such expression. Apigenin markedly enhanced the cisplatin-induced suppression of Hep-2 cell growth. This effect was concentration- and time-dependent. Thus apigenin may significantly reduce the levels of GLUT-1 mRNA, and GLUT-1 and p-Akt proteins, in cisplatin-treated Hep-2 cells, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. To conclude, overexpression of GLUT-1 mRNA may be associated with the resistance to cisplatin of laryngeal carcinoma Hep-2 cells. Apigenin may enhance the sensitivity to cisplatin of laryngeal carcinoma cells via inhibition of GLUT-1 and p-Akt expression.},

abstract = {Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 5 and p38 activities are significantly increased in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Both p38 and Cdk5 promote neurodegeneration upon deregulation. However, to date the mechanistic link between Cdk5 and p38 remains unclear. This study presents the first mechanism showing Cdk5 as a major regulator of p38 cascade in neurons and in transgenic mouse model of AD. Using beta-amyloid and glutamate as the neurotoxic stimuli, our results show that deregulated Cdk5 induces p38 activation by increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal cells and in primary cortical neurons. Elimination of ROS inhibits p38 activation, revealing ROS as major stimuli of the p38 cascade. Importantly, Cdk5-mediated p38 activation increases c-Jun expression, thereby revealing a mechanistic link between deregulated Cdk5 and c-Jun level in AD brains. c-Jun is over-expressed in AD, and is believed to contribute significantly to neurodegeneration. Based on the proposed mechanism, Cdk5 inhibition is more neuroprotective relative to p38 and c-Jun, suggesting that Cdk5 is an upstream regulator of neurodegenerative pathways triggered by p38 and a preferable therapeutic target for AD.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a cellular self-digestion process activated in response to stresses such as energy deprivation and oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms by which energy deprivation and oxidative stress trigger autophagy remain undefined. Here, we report that activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by mitochondria-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) is required for autophagy in cultured endothelial cells. AMPK activity, ROS levels, and the markers of autophagy were monitored in confluent bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) treated with the glycolysis blocker 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). Treatment of BAEC with 2-DG (5 mM) for 24 hours or with low concentrations of H(2)O(2) (100 µM) induced autophagy, including increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, accumulation of GFP-tagged LC3 positive intracellular vacuoles, and increased fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes. 2-DG-treatment also induced AMPK phosphorylation, which was blocked by either co-administration of two potent anti-oxidants (Tempol and N-Acetyl-L-cysteine) or overexpression of superoxide dismutase 1 or catalase in BAEC. Further, 2-DG-induced autophagy in BAEC was blocked by overexpressing catalase or siRNA-mediated knockdown of AMPK. Finally, pretreatment of BAEC with 2-DG increased endothelial cell viability after exposure to hypoxic stress. Thus, AMPK is required for ROS-triggered autophagy in endothelial cells, which increases endothelial cell survival in response to cell stress.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Light microscopy is of central importance in cell biology. The recent introduction of automated high content screening has expanded this technology towards automation of experiments and performing large scale perturbation assays. Nevertheless, evaluation of microscopy data continues to be a bottleneck in many projects. Currently, among open source software, CellProfiler and its extension Analyst are widely used in automated image processing. Even though revolutionizing image analysis in current biology, some routine and many advanced tasks are either not supported or require programming skills of the researcher. This represents a significant obstacle in many biology laboratories.

RESULTS: We have developed a tool, Enhanced CellClassifier, which circumvents this obstacle. Enhanced CellClassifier starts from images analyzed by CellProfiler, and allows multi-class classification using a Support Vector Machine algorithm. Training of objects can be done by clicking directly "on the microscopy image" in several intuitive training modes. Many routine tasks like out-of focus exclusion and well summary are also supported. Classification results can be integrated with other object measurements including inter-object relationships. This makes a detailed interpretation of the image possible, allowing the differentiation of many complex phenotypes. For the generation of the output, image, well and plate data are dynamically extracted and summarized. The output can be generated as graphs, Excel-files, images with projections of the final analysis and exported as variables.

CONCLUSION: Here we describe Enhanced CellClassifier which allows multiple class classification, elucidating complex phenotypes. Our tool is designed for the biologist who wants both, simple and flexible analysis of images without requiring programming skills. This should facilitate the implementation of automated high-content screening.},

By using murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that are deficient in TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 2 and TRAF5 (DKO) or p65 NF-$\kappa$B subunit (p65KO), we demonstrate here that TNF stimulation leads to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is essential for prolonged mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and cell death. Interestingly, dying cells show necrotic as well as apoptotic morphological changes as assessed by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, and necrotic, but not apoptotic, cell death is substantially inhibited by antioxidant. Importantly, TNF does not induce ROS accumulation or prolonged MAPK activation in wild-type MEFs, indicating that TRAF-mediated NF-$\kappa$B activation normally suppresses the TNF-induced ROS accumulation that subsequently induces prolonged MAPK activation and necrotic cell death},

Furthermore, Twist1 and Bmi1 were mutually essential to promote EMT and tumour-initiating capability. Twist1 and Bmi1 act cooperatively to repress expression of both E-cadherin and p16INK4a. In patients with head and neck cancers, increased levels of both Twist1 and Bmi1 correlated with downregulation of E-cadherin and p16INK4a, and was associated with the worst prognosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In the present study, the metabolomic analysis of serum and tissue samples obtained from patients with HNSCC was performed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.

RESULTS: In serum, levels of several metabolites related to the glycolytic pathway, such as glucose, were higher in patients with HNSCC, and the levels of several amino acids were lower. In contrast to sera, the levels of many metabolites related to the glycolytic pathway appeared to be lower in tumor tissues of HNSCC than in non-tumorous tissues, and the levels of several amino acids, such as valine, thyrosine, serine and methionine, were higher.

CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that changes in metabolite patterns are useful in assessing the clinical characteristics of HNSCC, and will hopefully lead to the establishment of novel diagnostic tools.},

abstract = {To enhance glucose uptake into muscle and fat cells, insulin stimulates the translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters from intracellular membranes to the cell surface. This response requires the intersection of insulin signaling and vesicle trafficking pathways, and it is compromised in the setting of overnutrition to cause insulin resistance. Insulin signals through AS160/Tbc1D4 and Tbc1D1 to modulate Rab GTPases and through the Rho GTPase TC10$\alpha$ to act on other targets. In unstimulated cells, GLUT4 is incorporated into specialized storage vesicles containing IRAP, LRP1, sortilin, and VAMP2, which are sequestered by TUG, Ubc9, and other proteins. Insulin mobilizes these vesicles directly to the plasma membrane, and it modulates the trafficking itinerary so that cargo recycles from endosomes during ongoing insulin exposure. Knowledge of how signaling and trafficking pathways are coordinated will be essential to understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome and may also inform a wide range of other physiologies.},

abstract = {Larger organisms have more potentially carcinogenic cells, tend to live longer and require more ontogenic cell divisions. Therefore, intuitively one might expect cancer incidence to scale with body size. Evidence from mammals, however, suggests that the cancer risk does not correlate with body size. This observation defines "Peto's paradox." Here, we propose a novel hypothesis to resolve Peto's paradox. We suggest that malignant tumors are disadvantaged in larger hosts. In particular, we hypothesize that natural selection acting on competing phenotypes among the cancer cell population will tend to favor aggressive "cheaters" that then grow as a tumor on their parent tumor, creating a hypertumor that damages or destroys the original neoplasm. In larger organisms, tumors need more time to reach lethal size, so hypertumors have more time to evolve. So, in large organisms, cancer may be more common and less lethal. We illustrate this hypothesis in silico using a previously published hypertumor model. Results from the model predict that malignant neoplasms in larger organisms should be disproportionately necrotic, aggressive, and vascularized than deadly tumors in small mammals. These predictions may serve as the basis on which to test the hypothesis, but to our knowledge, no one has yet performed a systematic investigation of comparative necrosis, histopathology, or vascularization among mammalian cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cancer cells require increased nutrient uptake to support a high rate of proliferation, and the overexpression of glucose transporters, in particular GLUT1, is a common characteristic of human malignancies. Here, we investigated the relationship between the expression of GLUT1 and cell viability, colony forming ability and apoptosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model in vivo.

METHODS: Lentiviral mediated overexpression and knock-down of GLUT1 was performed in two oral cancer cell lines (CAL27 and SCC25). QRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to detect the mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF$\kappa$B) p65 subunit. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by MTT and flow cytometry analyses, respectively. Colony formation assays were performed by staining with 0.5{\%} crystal violet. The role of GLUT1 in HNSCC was examined in vivo through the generation of a CAL27 (or CAL27 with different transfections) nude mice xenograft model of HNSCC.

RESULTS: GLUT1 overexpression promoted cell viability and colony formation whereas GLUT1 silencing had the opposite effect. GLUT1 knock-down significantly increased the number of Annexin V positive cells in both cell lines and GLUT1 overexpression had the opposite effect, indicating that GLUT1 modulates apoptosis. Xenograft mouse models of GLUT1 knockdown and overexpression showed that GLUT1 expression was associated with poor survival and increased tumor growth. GLUT1 overexpression significantly upregulated the expression of NF$\kappa$B-p65, and this effect was reversed by inhibition of GLUT1 expression.

CONCLUSIONS: GLUT1 expression plays an important role in the survival of HNSCC, and its effects may be associated with the activation of the NF$\kappa$B pathway.},

abstract = {The processes of cellular growth regulation and cellular metabolism are closely interrelated. The c-Myc oncogene is a "master regulator" which controls many aspects of both of these processes. The metabolic changes which occur in transformed cells, many of which are driven by c-Myc overexpression, are necessary to support the increased need for nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids necessary for rapid cellular proliferation. At the same time, c-Myc overexpression results in coordinated changes in level of expression of gene families which result in increased cellular proliferation. This interesting duality of c-Myc effects places it in the mainstream of transformational changes and gives it a very important role in regulating the "transformed phenotype." The effects induced by c-Myc can occur either as a "primary oncogene" which is activated by amplification or translocation or as a downstream effect of other activated oncogenes. In either case, it appears that c-Myc plays a central role in sustaining the changes which occur with transformation. Although efforts to use c-Myc as a therapeutic target have been quite frustrating, it appears that this may change in the next few years.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) progressing after first-line platinum regimens have a poor prognosis and few treatment options. Afatinib, an irreversible ERBB family blocker, has shown efficacy in a phase 2 study in this setting. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib compared with methotrexate as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC progressing on or after platinum-based therapy.

METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial conducted in 101 centres in 19 countries, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed HNSCC that was recurrent, metastatic, or both who had progressed on or after first-line platinum-based therapy, were not amenable for salvage surgery or radiotherapy, and who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Previous treatment with more than one systemic regimen in this setting was not allowed; previous treatment with EGFR-targeted antibody therapy (but not EGFR-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) was allowed. We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) or intravenous methotrexate (40 mg/m(2) per week), stratified by ECOG performance status and previous EGFR-targeted antibody therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice or web-based response system. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent, central imaging review committee. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01345682.

FINDINGS: Between Jan 10, 2012, and Dec 12, 2013, we enrolled 483 patients and randomly assigned 322 to afatinib and 161 to methotrexate. After a median follow-up of 6{\textperiodcentered}7 months (IQR 3{\textperiodcentered}1-9{\textperiodcentered}0), progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group than in the methotrexate group (median 2{\textperiodcentered}6 months [95{\%} CI 2{\textperiodcentered}0-2{\textperiodcentered}7] for the afatinib group vs 1{\textperiodcentered}7 months [1{\textperiodcentered}5-2{\textperiodcentered}4] for the methotrexate group; hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}80 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}65-0{\textperiodcentered}98], p=0{\textperiodcentered}030). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were rash or acne (31 [10{\%}] of 320 patients in the afatinib group vs none of 160 patients in the methotrexate group), diarrhoea (30 [9{\%}] vs three [2{\%}]), stomatitis (20 [6{\%}] vs 13 [8{\%}]), fatigue (18 [6{\%}] vs five [3{\%}]), and neutropenia (1 [{\textless}1{\%}] vs 11 [7{\%}]); serious adverse events occurred in 44 (14{\%}) of afatinib-treated patients and 18 (11{\%}) of methotrexate-treated patients.

INTERPRETATION: Afatinib was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival and had a manageable safety profile. These findings provide important new insights into the treatment of this patient population and support further investigations with irreversible ERBB family blockers in HNSCC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 170 LAHNC patients diagnosed between January 1, 2009, and July 31, 2012: 116 received CCRT and 54 received BioRT.

RESULTS: Complete response rates were similar in the SD-CCRT and BioRT groups (63.8{\%} versus 59.3{\%}; P = 0.807), and locoregional relapse rates were 18.1{\%} and 13.0{\%}, respectively (P = 0.400). The 3-year relapse-free survival rate was 65.8{\%} in the SD-CCRT group and 65.5{\%} in the BioRT group, respectively (P = 0.647). The 3-year overall survival rate was 78.5{\%} in the SD-CCRT group and 70.9{\%} in the BioRT group, respectively (P = 0.879). Hematologic side effects were significantly more frequent in the SD-CCRT than in the BioRT group. Mucositis frequency was similar.

CONCLUSIONS: Primary SD-CCRT and BioRT both showed good clinical response and survival. Hematologic toxicities were more frequent, but tolerable, in the SD-CCRT group. Both groups showed good compliance.},

Losses may be either accidenta1 or controlled, the 1atter resu1ting from a decision to terminate certain observations. In either case it is usually assumed in this paper that the 1ifetime (age at death) is independent of the potentia1 10ss time; in practice this assumption deserves carefu1 scrutiny. Despite the resu1ting incomp1eteness of the data, it is desired to estimate the proportion P(t) of items in the popu1ation whose lifetimes wou1d exceed t (in the absence of such losses), without making any assumption about the form of the function P(t). The observation for each item of a suitab1e initia1 event, marking the beginning of its lifetime, is presupposed. For random samp1es of size N the product-limit (PL) estimate can be defined as follows: List and 1abe1 the N observed lifetimes (whether to death or 10ss) in order of increasing magnitude, so that one has O {\textless}= t1' {\textless}= t2' {\textless}= ... {\textless}= tN'. Then P(t) =greek P(r) [(N -r)/(N -r+1)], where r assumes those va1ues for which tr' {\textless}= t and for which tr' measures the time to death. This estimate is the distribution, unrestricted as to form, which maximizes the likelihood of the observations. Other estimates that are discussed are the actuaria1 estimates (which are a1so products, but with the number of factors usually reduced by grouping); and reduced-samp1e (RS) estimates, which require that 10sses not be accidenta1, so that the limits of observation (potentia110ss times) are known even for those items whose deaths are observed.

abstract = {Studies employing native PAGE suggest that most nDNA-encoded CI subunits form subassemblies before assembling into holo-CI. In addition, in vitro evidence suggests that some subunits can directly exchange in holo-CI. Presently, data on the kinetics of these two incorporation modes for individual CI subunits during CI maintenance are sparse. Here, we used inducible HEK293 cell lines stably expressing AcGFP1-tagged CI subunits and quantified the amount of tagged subunit in mitoplasts and holo-CI by non-native and native PAGE, respectively, to determine their CI incorporation efficiency. Analysis of time courses of induction revealed three subunit-specific patterns. A first pattern, represented by NDUFS1, showed overlapping time courses, indicating that imported subunits predominantly incorporate into holo-CI. A second pattern, represented by NDUFV1, consisted of parallel time courses, which were, however, not quantitatively overlapping, suggesting that imported subunits incorporate at similar rates into holo-CI and CI assembly intermediates. The third pattern, represented by NDUFS3 and NDUFA2, revealed a delayed incorporation into holo-CI, suggesting their prior appearance in CI assembly intermediates and/or as free monomers. Our analysis showed the same maximum incorporation into holo-CI for NDUFV1, NDUFV2, NDUFS1, NDUFS3, NDUFS4, NDUFA2, and NDUFA12 with nearly complete loss of endogenous subunit at 24 h of induction, indicative of an equimolar stoichiometry and unexpectedly rapid turnover. In conclusion, the results presented demonstrate that newly formed nDNA-encoded CI subunits rapidly incorporate into holo-CI in a subunit-specific manner.},

abstract = {In the present study, we examined signal transduction mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the role of ROS in angiotensin II-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Among three MAPKs, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK required ROS production for activation, as an NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium, inhibited the activation. The angiotensin II-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK was also inhibited by the expression of the G$\alpha$12/13-specific regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain, a specific inhibitor of G$\alpha$12/13, but not by an RGS domain specific for G$\alpha$q. Constitutively active G$\alpha$12- or G$\alpha$13-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), was inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium. Angiotensin II receptor stimulation rapidly activated G$\alpha$13, which was completely inhibited by the G$\alpha$12/13-specific RGS domain. Furthermore, the G$\alpha$12/13-specific but not the G$\alpha$q-specific RGS domain inhibited angiotensin II-induced ROS production. Dominant negative Rac inhibited angiotensin II-stimulated ROS production, JNK activation, and p38 MAPK activation but did not affect ERK activation. Rac activation was mediated by Rho and Rho kinase, because Rac activation was inhibited by C3 toxin and a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. Furthermore, angiotensin II-induced Rho activation was inhibited by G$\alpha$12/13-specific RGS domain but not dominant negative Rac. An inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor kinase AG1478 did not affect angiotensin II-induced JNK activation cascade. These results suggest that G$\alpha$12/13-mediated ROS production through Rho and Rac is essential for JNK and p38 MAPK activation. Previous Section Next Section Ang II1 is a bioactive peptide involved in cardiac hypertrophy (1). Receptor stimulation by Ang II is assumed to activate Gq and Gi and turns on various signaling cascades dependent on cell types. Many groups have reported the regulation of MAPKs including JNK (2, 3), ERK (4, 5), and p38 MAPK (6) in a variety of cells (7). MAPKs are thought to be key intracellular transducers of mitogenic stimulation and have been implicated in the signaling pathways leading to cardiac hypertrophy (8, 9). An earlier study demonstrated that Ang II-induced JNK activation is dependent on extracellular calcium and protein kinase C and partially on a tyrosine kinase (2). On the other hand, Ang II-induced ERK activation is mediated by the Ras pathway or protein kinase C pathway (10). A recent study showed that $\beta$-arrestin-mediated internalization of ATR is involved in ERK activation (11). ERK or p38 MAPK activation by Ang II requires the EGF receptor transactivation, whereas JNK activation is regulated by other signaling proteins (7). These results indicate that the signal transduction mechanism of MAPK activation depends on the types of MAPKs and cellular contexts that are analyzed. ROS such as hydrogen peroxide and oxygen radicals play various roles in living cells as a second messenger to elicit physiological responses or as a toxic intermediate leading to cellular damage (12). Recent studies suggest that ROS work as regulators of signal transduction (13, 14). We have reported that heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins are putative target molecules of ROS (15, 16). Although Ang II produces ROS in vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes (6, 17, 18), the molecular mechanism of ROS production and the identification of ROS target molecules are largely unknown. Rac, one of the small GTP-binding proteins, is believed to participate in the production of ROS by activating NADPH oxidase in neutrophil (19). Previous findings have demonstrated that one of the Rac effector PAKs mediates JNK activation by Ang II, and PAK phosphorylates a subunit of the NADPH oxidase complex (20). MAPKs are activated by Rac as well as RhoA and Raf-1, and the resulting activation of MAPKs induces hypertrophic responses through the activation of intracellular signaling cascades (21-24). However, upstream molecules of and the relationship between these intracellular signaling molecules are not fully determined. G12 family G proteins, G12 and G13, couple with various G protein-coupled receptors and mediate physiological responses by interacting with different signaling proteins (25). The role of G12/13 in the heart, however, has not been revealed because of the unavailability of a specific inhibitor. Recent studies showed that p115RhoGEF has an RGS domain for G$\alpha$12/13 (26, 27). We examined by using the RGS domain of p115RhoGEF whether G12/13 is involved in Ang II-mediated signal transduction pathway and ROS production and whether ROS work as a mediator in cardiac myocytes. To demonstrate the signal transduction cascade, we constructed various recombinant adenoviruses coding G$\alpha$12/13- or G$\alpha$q-specific RGS domains and DN-Rac. We demonstrate in the present study that Ang II-induced JNK and p38 MAPK activation requires ROS, and Ang II-induced ROS production is mediated by sequential activation of G12/13, Rho, and Rac.},

All the studied tumor lines grew as monolayers, and showed: i) an epithelial origin by the presence of cytokeratin, and ii) tumorigenic potential in nude mice. Western blot analysis revealed i) over expression of EGFR in six of the cell lines ii) decreased expression of E-cadherin in six cell lines compared to normal human oral mucosa. A mutational analysis showed: point mutations of p53 at exon 7, with transversion, and at exon 8, with transition.

abstract = {Oncogenic mutations within RAS genes and inactivation of p53 are the most common events in cancer. Earlier we reported that activated Ras contributes to chromosome instability, especially in p53-deficient cells. Here we show that an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative DNA damage represents a major mechanism of Ras-induced mutagenesis. Introduction of oncogenic H- or N-Ras caused elevated intracellular ROS, accumulation of 8-oxo-dG and increased number of chromosome breaks in mitotic cells, which were prevented by antioxidant N-acethyl-L-cysteine (NAC). By using Ras mutants that selectively activate either of the three major targets of Ras (Raf, RalGDS and PI3K) as well as dominant-negative Rac1 and RalA mutants and inhibitors of MEK1 and p38 MAPKs we have demonstrated that several Ras effectors independently mediate ROS up-regulation. Introduction of oncogenic RAS resulted in repression of transcription from sestrin family genes SESN1 and SESN3, which encode antioxidant modulators of peroxiredoxins. Inhibition of mRNAs from these genes in control cells by RNAi increased substantially ROS levels and mutagenesis. Ectopic expression of SESN1 and SESN3 from lentiviral constructs interfered with Ras-induced ROS increase suggesting their important contribution to the effect. The stability of Ras-induced increase in ROS was dependent on a p53 function: in the p53-positive cells displaying activation of p53 in response to Ras only transient (4–7 days) elevation of ROS was observed whereas in the p53-deficient cells the up-regulation was permanent. The reversion to normal ROS levels in the Ras-expressing p53-positive cells correlated with up-regulation of p53-responsive genes, including reactivation of SESN1 gene. Thus, changes in expression of sestrins can represent important determinant of genetic instability in neoplastic cells showing simultaneous dysfunctions of Ras and p53.},

abstract = {We have characterized the glucose-transport system in soleus muscle from female GLUT4-null mice to determine whether GLUT1, 3 or 5 account for insulin-stimulated glucose-transport activity. Insulin increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2.8- and 2.1-fold in soleus muscle from wild-type and GLUT4-null mice, respectively. Cytochalasin B, an inhibitor of GLUT1- and GLUT4-mediated glucose transport, inhibited insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake by {\textgreater}95{\%} in wild-type and GLUT4-null soleus muscle. Addition of 35 mM fructose to the incubation media was without effect on insulin-stimulated 3-O-methylglucose transport activity in soleus muscle from either genotype, whereas 35 mM glucose inhibited insulin-stimulated (20 nM) 3-O-methylglucose transport by 65{\%} in wild-type and 99{\%} in GLUT4-null mice. We utilized the 2-N-4-1-(1-azi-2,2,2-triflu oroethyl)benzoyl-1, 3-bis(D-mannose-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) exofacial photolabel to determine if increased cell-surface GLUT1 or GLUT4 content accounted for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in GLUT4-null muscle. In wild-type soleus muscle, cell-surface GLUT4 content was increased by 2.8-fold under insulin-stimulated conditions and this increase corresponded to the increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake. No detectable cell-surface GLUT4 was observed in soleus muscle from female GLUT4-null mice under either basal or insulin-stimulated conditions. Basal cell-surface GLUT1 content was similar between wild-type and GLUT4-null mice, with no further increase noted in either genotype with insulin exposure. Neither GLUT3 nor GLUT5 appeared to account for insulin-stimulated glucose-transport activity in wild-type or GLUT4-null muscle. In conclusion, insulin-stimulated glucose-transport activity in female GLUT4-null soleus muscle is mediated by a facilitative transport process that is glucose- and cytochalasin B-inhibitable, but which is not labelled strongly by ATB-BMPA.},

abstract = {Ectopic expression of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase on the plasma membrane has been reported to occur in cancer, but whether it exerts a functional role in this setting remains unclear. Here we show that ectopic ATP synthase and the electron transfer chain exist on the plasma membrane in a punctuated distribution of lung adenocarcinoma cells, where it is critical to support cancer cell proliferation. Applying ATP synthase inhibitor citreoviridin induced cell cycle arrest and inhibited proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of lung cancer cells. Analysis of protein expression profiles after citreoviridin treatment suggested this compound induced the unfolded protein response (UPR) associated with phosphorylation the translation initiation factor 2$\alpha$ (eIF2$\alpha$), triggering cell growth inhibition. Citreoviridin-enhanced eIF2$\alpha$ phosphorylation could be reversed by siRNA-mediated attenuation of the UPR kinase PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) combined with treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, establishing that reactive oxygen species (ROS) boost UPR after citreoviridin treatment. Thus, a coordinate elevation of UPR and ROS initiates a positive feedback loop that convergently blocks cell proliferation. Our findings define a molecular function for ectopic ATP synthase at the plasma membrane in lung cancer cells and they prompt further study of its inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach.},

abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

abstract = {The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is frequently mutated in human cancers. More than 75{\%} of all mutations are missense substitutions that have been extensively analyzed in various yeast and human cell assays. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 database (www-p53.iarc.fr) compiles all genetic variations that have been reported in TP53. Here, we present recent database developments that include new annotations on the functional properties of mutant proteins, and we perform a systematic analysis of the database to determine the functional properties that contribute to the occurrence of mutational "hotspots" in different cancer types and to the phenotype of tumors. This analysis showed that loss of transactivation capacity is a key factor for the selection of missense mutations, and that difference in mutation frequencies is closely related to nucleotide substitution rates along TP53 coding sequence. An interesting new finding is that in patients with an inherited missense mutation, the age at onset of tumors was related to the functional severity of the mutation, mutations with total loss of transactivation activity being associated with earlier cancer onset compared to mutations that retain partial transactivation capacity. Furthermore, 80{\%} of the most common mutants show a capacity to exert dominant-negative effect (DNE) over wild-type p53, compared to only 45{\%} of the less frequent mutants studied, suggesting that DNE may play a role in shaping mutation patterns. These results provide new insights into the factors that shape mutation patterns and influence mutation phenotype, which may have clinical interest.},

abstract = {p53 mutations are etiologically associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) or are associated with exposure to specific carcinogens. In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in OSCC tumor specimens from 187 patients with varied histories of betel quid, tobacco and alcohol use. Ninety-one of the 187 OSCCs (48.66{\%}) showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The incidence of p53 mutations was not associated with age, sex, TNM stage, status of cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing. However, alcohol drinkers exhibited a significantly higher incidence (57/101, 56.44{\%}) of p53 mutations than non-users (39.53{\%}, 34/86) (P = 0.02). The effect of alcohol on the incidence of p53 mutations was still statistically significant (RR = 2.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-4.15) after adjustment for cigarette smoking and betel quid (BQ) chewing. G:C to A:T transitions were the predominant mutations observed and associated with BQ and tobacco use. Alcohol drinking could enhance these transitions. After adjustment for cigarette smoking and BQ chewing, alcohol drinking still showed an independent effect on G:C to A:T transitions (RR = 2.41; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.74). These findings strongly suggest an important contributive role of tobacco carcinogens to p53 mutation in this series of Taiwanese OSCCs and alcohol might enhance these mutagenic effects. As safrole-DNA adducts have been detected in 77{\%} (23/30) of the OSCC tissues from Taiwanese oral cancer patients with a BQ chewing history, we cannot rule out the possibility that safrole or other carcinogens present in the BQ may cause a similar pattern of mutagenesis. Determination of the role of safrole and other carcinogens present in BQ on the pattern of p53 gene mutation in OSCC will require further study.},

The study aimed to detect changes of protein profiles associated with the process of colorectal tumorigenesis to identify specific protein markers for early colorectal cancer detection and diagnosis or as potential therapeutic targets. Seven pairs of colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal mucosa were examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis at basic pH range (pH 7-10). Intensity changes of 34 spots were detected with statistical significance. 16 of the 34 spots were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry. Changes in protein expression levels revealed a significantly enhanced glycolytic pathway (Warburg effect), a decreased gluconeogenesis, a suppressed glucuronic acid pathway, and an impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle. Observed changes in protein abundance were verified by two-dimensional DIGE. These changes reveal an underlying mechanism of colorectal tumorigenesis in which the roles of impaired tricarboxylic acid cycle and the Warburg effect may be critical.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), like many solid tumors, contains a heterogeneous population of cancer cells. Recent data suggest that a rare subpopulation of cancer cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSC), is capable of initiating, maintaining, and expanding the growth of tumor. Identification and characterization of CSC from OSCC facilitates the monitoring, therapy, or prevention of OSCC.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We enriched oral cancer stem-like cells (OC-SLC) through sphere formation by cultivating OSCC cells from established OSCC cell lines or primary cultures of OSCC patients within defined serum-free medium. Differential expression profile of stemness genes between enriched OC-SLC and parental OSCC was elucidated. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of stemness markers on OSCC patient tissues was examined to evaluate the association between stemness genes and prognosis of OSCC.

RESULTS: Enriched OC-SLC highly expressed the stem/progenitor cell markers and ABC transporter gene (Oct-4, Nanog, CD117, Nestin, CD133, and ABCG2) and also displayed induced differentiation abilities and enhanced migration/invasion/malignancy capabilities in vitro and in vivo. Elevated expression of CD133 was shown in the enriched OC-SLC from OSCC patients' tumors. Positive correlations of Oct-4, Nanog, or CD133 expression on tumor stage were shown on 52 OSCC patient tissues. Kaplan-Meier analyses exhibited that Nanog/Oct-4/CD133 triple-positive patients predicted the worst survival prognosis of OSCC patients.

CONCLUSION: We enriched a subpopulation of cancer stem-like cell from OSCC by sphere formation. The enriched OC-SLC possesses the characteristics of both stem cells and malignant tumors. Additionally, expression of stemness markers (Nanog/Oct-4/CD133) contradicts the survival prognosis of OSCC patients.},

abstract = {Safflower seed has been reported to have a protective effect against bone loss diseases. However, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of safflower seed in osteoclast differentiation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory action of safflower seed extract (SSE) on the receptor activator of nuclear factor $\kappa$B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis in cultured mouse-derived bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). We found that SSE significantly inhibited the formation of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells in BMMs without cytotoxicity. The gene expressions of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFATc1) and TRAP, which are genetic markers of osteoclast differentiation, were substantially decreased by SSE in a dose-dependent manner. Also, SSE diminished RANKL-mediated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation on osteoclastogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. The SSE thereafter suppressed RANKL-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ kinase signalling activities which were activated by ROS generation for osteoclastogenesis. Additionally, SSE was found to decrease RANKL-induced actin ring formation, which is required for bone resorption activity. Taken together, our results suggest that SSE acts as a RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis inhibitor by suppression of ROS generation. This induces a remarkable suppression of the p38 and I$\kappa$B$\alpha$ kinase pathways, thereby suppressing the gene expression of NFATc1 in osteoclast precursors.},

abstract = {The increased glucose metabolism in cancer cells is required to fulfill their high energetic and biosynthetic demands. Changes in the metabolic activity of cancer cells are caused by the activation of oncogenes or loss of tumor suppressors. They can also be part of the metabolic adaptations to the conditions imposed by the tumor microenvironment, such as the hypoxia response. Among the metabolic enzymes that are modulated by these factors are the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatases (PFKFBs), a family of bifunctional enzymes that control the levels of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (Fru-2,6-P2). This metabolite is important for the dynamic regulation of glycolytic flux by allosterically activating the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Therapeutic strategies designed to alter the levels of this metabolite are likely to interfere with the metabolic balance of cancer cells, and could lead to a reduction in cancer cell proliferation, invasiveness and survival. This article will review our current understanding of the role of PFKFB proteins in the control of cancer metabolism and discuss the emerging interest in these enzymes as potential targets for the development of antineoplastic agents.},

abstract = {microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation contributes widely to human cancer but has not been fully assessed in oral cancers. In this study, we conducted a global microarray analysis of miRNA expression in 40 pairs of betel quid-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) specimens and their matched nontumorous epithelial counterparts. Eighty-four miRNAs were differentially expressed in the OSCC specimens compared with the matched tissue. Among these downregulated miRNAs, 19 miRNAs were found and mapped to the chromosome 14q32.2 miRNA cluster region, which resides within a parentally imprinted region designated as Dlk-Dio3 and known to be important in development and growth. Bioinformatic analysis predicted two miRNAs from the cluster region, miR329 and miR410, which could potentially target Wnt-7b, an activator of the Wnt-$\beta$-catenin pathway, thereby attenuating the Wnt-$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway in OSCC. Stable ectopic expression of Wnt-7b in OSCC cells overexpressing miR329 or miR410 restored proliferation and invasion capabilities abolished by these miRNA. Combining a demethylation agent and a histone deacetylase inhibitor was sufficient to reexpress miR329, miR410, and Meg3, consistent with epigenetic regulation of these miRNA in human OSCC.

abstract = {The facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4 plays a key role in regulating whole body glucose homeostasis. GLUT4 dramatically changes its distribution upon insulin stimulation, and insulin-resistant diabetes is often linked with compromised translocation of GLUT4 under insulin stimulation. To elucidate the functional significance of the sole N-glycan chain on GLUT4, wild-type GLUT4 and a GLUT4 glycosylation mutant conjugated with enhanced GFP were stably expressed in HeLa cells. The N-glycan contributed to the overall stability of newly synthesized GLUT4. Moreover, cell surface expression of wild-type GLUT4 in HeLa cells was elevated upon insulin treatment, whereas the glycosylation mutant lost the ability to respond to insulin. Subcellular distribution of the mutant was distinct from that of wild-type GLUT4, implying that the subcellular localization required for insulin-mediated translocation was impaired in the mutant protein. Interestingly, kifunensine-treated cells also lost sensitivity to insulin, suggesting the functional importance of the N-glycan structure for GLUT4 trafficking. The K(m) or turnover rates of wild-type and mutant GLUT4, however, were similar, suggesting that the N-glycan had little effect on transporter activity. These findings underscore the critical roles of the N-glycan chain in quality control as well as intracellular trafficking of GLUT4.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Desmocollin3 (DSC3) is a member of the cadherin superfamily of calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules and plays an important role in tumor invasion and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic mechanism that regulates DSC3 expression in esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs).

METHODS: Expression of DSC3 was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The promoter DNA methylation level of DSC3 was examined using quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing.

RESULTS: The qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated significant down-regulation of the DSC3 mRNA levels in human EAC cell lines and tissue samples (P{\textless}.001). In addition, the EAC cell lines and tumor samples have aberrant promoter hypermethylation as compared to normal esophageal samples (P{\textless}.001). DSC3 promoter hypermethylation ({\textgreater}10{\%} methylation level) was detected in 97.5{\%} (39/40) of EAC samples whereas none of the normal tissue samples showed hypermethylation (P{\textless}.0001). There was a significant inverse correlation between promoter DNA methylation levels and mRNA expression folds for DSC3 (coefficient r=-0.685, P{\textless}.0001). Treatment of FLO-1 and SKGT4 EAC cells with 5-Aza-deoxytidine led to a significant reduction in the promoter DNA methylation levels with restoration of the DSC3 expression, suggesting that promoter DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism regulating DSC3 expression. High DSC3 promoter DNA methylation levels were significantly correlated with advanced tumor stage (P{\textless}.001) and lymph node metastasis (P{\textless}.001).

CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results demonstrate that epigenetic silencing of DSC3 is a frequent finding in EAC that is possibly associated with advanced stages.},

To assess whether iodinated acetals 1 and 2 interacted with the glucose transporter, they were tested in vitro in human erythrocytes (GluT1) and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (GluT4). The results indicated that 1 and 2 had a very low affinity for the glucose transporter and probably accumulated in cells.

abstract = {Early detection and effective treatments have dramatically improved breast cancer survivorship, yet the risk of relapse persists even 15 years after the initial diagnosis. It is important to identify prognostic factors for late breast cancer events. The authors investigated time-varying effects of tumor characteristics on breast-cancer-free survival using data on 3,088 breast cancer survivors from 4 US states who participated in a randomized dietary intervention trial in 1995-2006, with maximum follow-up through 15 years (median, 9 years). A piecewise constant penalized spline approach incorporating time-varying coefficients was adopted, allowing for deviations from the proportional hazards assumption. This method is more flexible than standard approaches, provides direct estimates of hazard ratios across time intervals, and is computationally tractable. Having a stage II or III tumor was associated with a 3-fold higher hazard of breast cancer than having a stage I tumor during the first 2.5 years after diagnosis; this hazard ratio decreased to 2.1 after 7.7 years, but higher tumor stage remained a significant risk factor. Similar diminishing effects were found for poorly differentiated tumors. Interestingly, having a positive estrogen receptor status was protective up to 4 years after diagnosis but detrimental after 7.7 years (hazard ratio = 1.5). These results emphasize the importance of careful statistical modeling allowing for possibly time-dependent effects in long-term survivorship studies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Betel quid (BQ) components induce the secretion of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) in oral keratinocytes, which promotes oral mucosal inflammation and oral cancer. This study was carried out to evaluate the association of TNFA genetic variants (-308G{\textgreater}A and -238G{\textgreater}A) with the risk and prognosis of BQ-related oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC).

DESIGN: A total of 403 subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were determined by TaqMan real-time assays.

RESULTS: G allele and G/G genotype at TNFA -308 were associated with a 1.95-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.16-3.28, p(corrected)=0.024) and 2.28-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.30-4.00, p(corrected)=0.008) increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele or A/A+A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele (p=0.080) and G/G genotype (p=0.076) at TNFA -238 were associated with a borderline but statistically significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G+G/G genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes (95{\%}CI: 1.41-4.00, p=0.001). Interactions between combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic findings or the survival of OPSCC patients.

CONCLUSIONS: BQ-chewers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA -308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC. The intensity of cigarette smoking modulates the effect of the combined TNFA genotypes on risk of BQ-related OPSCC.},

abstract = {The induction of proangiogenic cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical feature of tumor angiogenesis. In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of VEGF gene expression induced by glucose deprivation in cancer cells, a role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in the process, and the signal transduction pathway. AMPK functions as an energy sensor to provide metabolic adaptation under ATP-depleting conditions such as hypoxia and nutritional deprivation. Here, we show that glucose deprivation leads to a significant increase in the mRNA level of VEGF, GLUT1, and PFKFB3 genes in several cancer cells via a hypoxia-inducible factor-1-independent mechanism, and we demonstrate an essential role of AMPK in these gene expressions. Our data suggest that VEGF mRNA induction by glucose deprivation is due to an increase in mRNA stability, and the AMPK activity is necessary and sufficient to confer the stability to VEGF mRNA. We further show that reactive oxygen species is involved in glucose deprivation-induced AMPK activity in DU145 human prostate carcinomas, and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase acts as an upstream component in AMPK activation cascades under these conditions. LKB1, which was recently identified as a direct upstream kinase of AMPK, was not detected in DU145 cells. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a novel and major role of AMPK in the post-transcriptional regulation of VEGF, further implying its potential role in tumor angiogenesis. Previous Section Next Section As solid tumors outgrow the existing vasculature, they are continuously exposed to microenvironments where the supply of oxygen and nutrients are limited. Adaptation to such environments by induction of new blood vessels is critical to sustain neoplastic proliferation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 plays a central role in this process (1, 2). A variety of human tumors and tumor cell lines express and secrete high levels of VEGF, which in turn induces proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells. One of the best known environmental factors that up-regulate VEGF expression in tumors is hypoxia, and this induction occurs primarily via transcriptional activation by HIF-1 (a heterodimeric transcription factor composed of HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-1$\beta$) (3, 4). Its activity largely depends on accumulation of the oxygen-regulated subunit HIF-1$\alpha$, which is rapidly degraded under normoxic conditions and is stabilized under hypoxic conditions (3). Besides VEGF, several target genes, including GLUT1 (glucose transporter 1) and PFKFB3 (6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase-3), are up-regulated by HIF-1 (3, 4). In concert with transcriptional regulation, hypoxia also increases the mRNA stability of VEGF, and the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA has been implicated in the regulation of its stability (5). In addition to a lack of oxygen delivery, glucose deprivation is another key factor to which tumors must respond and adapt as they outgrow the existing vasculature. In fact, several studies demonstrated that glucose deprivation also induces VEGF expression in different types of cancer cells (6–8), and a post-transcriptional regulation has been implicated under the existing conditions (6, 7). However, the precise mechanism as well as the regulatory components for low glucose-induced VEGF expression remain almost unknown. AMPK, a heterotrimer consisting of a catalytic subunit ($\alpha$) and two regulatory subunits ($\beta$ and $\gamma$), functions as an energy sensor in eukaryotic cells (9, 10). It is sensitively activated by allosteric binding of AMP, which is accumulated as a result of ATP depletion under various metabolic stresses such as hypoxia, nutrition deprivation, oxidative stress, and exercise. AMPK is also activated when it is phosphorylated by an upstream kinase. Upon activation, AMPK down-regulates several anabolic enzymes by phosphorylation and shuts down the ATP-consuming metabolic pathways, whereas its activation facilitates energy-producing pathways, thereby playing a major role in energy homeostasis. We have previously demonstrated that AMPK activity is critical for HIF-1 activity and its target gene expression such as VEGF under hypoxic conditions (11). In the present study, we investigated whether AMPK plays any role in the regulation of expression of genes that are critically involved in cancer adaptation and survival such as VEGF, GLUT1, and PFKFB3 under glucose-deprived conditions. In particular, our focus was on revealing the mechanisms of VEGF mRNA induction, a role of AMPK, and its signaling pathway. Here, we present novel evidence on the increase in VEGF mRNA stability through ROS-mediated activation of AMPK in DU145 cancer cells under glucose deprivation. Moreover, we reveal for the first time that JNK acts as an upstream signal component of AMPK in the signal pathway.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate low-dose extended duration interferon alfa-2a as adjuvant therapy in patients with thick ({\textgreater} or = 4 mm) primary cutaneous melanoma and/or locoregional metastases. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial involving 674 patients, the effect of interferon alfa-2a (3 megaunits three times per week for 2 years or until recurrence) on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was compared with that of no further treatment in radically resected stage IIB and stage III cutaneous malignant melanoma. RESULTS: The OS and RFS rates at 5 years were 44{\%} (SE, 2.6) and 32{\%} (SE, 2.1), respectively. There was no significant difference in OS or RFS between the interferon-treated and control arms (odds ratio [OR], 0.94; 95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 1.18; P =.6; and OR, 0.91; 95{\%} CI, 0.75 to 1.10; P =.3; respectively). Male sex (P =.003) and regional lymph node involvement (P =.0009), but not age (P =.7), were statistically significant adverse features for OS. Subgroup analysis by disease stage, age, and sex did not show any clear differences between interferon-treated and control groups in either OS or RFS. Interferon-related toxicities were modest: grade 3 (and in only one case, grade 4) fatigue or mood disturbance was seen in 7{\%} and 4{\%} respectively, of patients. However, there were 50 withdrawals (15{\%}) from interferon treatment due to toxicity. CONCLUSION: The results from this study, taken in isolation, do not indicate that extended-duration low-dose interferon is significantly better than observation alone in the initial treatment of completely resected high-risk malignant melanoma.},

abstract = {Tumor cells have an increased demand for nutrients; this demand is met by increased availability of nutrients through vasculogenesis and by enhanced cellular entry of nutrients through upregulation of specific transporters. This review focuses on three groups of nutrient transporters relevant to cancer: glucose transporters, lactate transporters, and amino acid transporters. Tumor cells enhance glucose uptake via induction of GLUT1 and SGLT1, and coordinate the increased entry of glucose with increased glycolysis. Since enhanced glycolysis in cancer is associated with lactate production, tumor cells must find a way to eliminate lactic acid to prevent cellular acidification. This is achieved by the upregulation of MCT4, a H+-coupled lactate transporter. In addition, the Na+-coupled lactate transporter SMCT1 is silenced in cancer. SMCT1 also transports butyrate and pyruvate, which are inhibitors of histone deacetylases. The silencing of SMCT1 occurs in cancers of a variety of tissues. Re-expression of SMCT1 in cancer cell lines leads to growth arrest and apoptosis in the presence of butyrate or pyruvate, suggesting that the transporter may function as a tumor suppressor. Tumor cells meet their amino acid demands by inducing xCT/4F2hc, LAT1/4F2hc, ASCT2, and ATB0,+. xCT/4F2hc is related primarily to glutathione status, protection against oxidative stress, and cell cycle progression, whereas the other three transporters are related to amino acid nutrition. Pharmacologic blockade of LAT1/4F2hc, xCT/4F2hc, or ATB0,+ leads to inhibition of cancer cell growth. Since tumor cells selectively regulate these nutrient transporters to support their rapid growth, these transporters have potential as drug targets for cancer therapy.},

abstract = {The uncovering of genes involved in susceptibility to the sporadic cancer types is a great challenge. It is well established that the way in which an individual deals with DNA damage is related to the chance to develop cancer. Mutagen sensitivity is a phenotype that reflects an individual's susceptibility to the major sporadic cancer types, including colon, lung, and head and neck cancer. A standard test for mutagen sensitivity is measuring the number of chromatid breaks in lymphocytes after exposure to bleomycin. The aim of the present study was to search for the pathways involved in mutagen sensitivity. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of seven individuals with low mutagen sensitivity were compared with seven individuals with a high score. RNA was isolated from cells exposed to bleomycin (4 hours) and from unexposed cells. Microarray analysis (19K) was used to compare gene expression of insensitive and sensitive cells. The profile of most altered genes after bleomycin exposure, analyzed in all 14 cell lines, included relatively many genes involved in biological processes, such as cell growth and/or maintenance, proliferation, and regulation of cell cycle, as well as some genes involved in DNA repair. When comparing the insensitive and sensitive individuals, other differentially expressed genes were found that are involved in signal transduction and cell growth and/or maintenance (e.g., BUB1 and DUSP4). This difference in expression profiles between mutagen-sensitive and mutagen-insensitive individuals justifies further studies aimed at elucidating the genes responsible for the development of sporadic cancers.},

abstract = {Loss of stromal fibroblast caveolin-1 (Cav-1) is a powerful single independent predictor of poor prognosis in human breast cancer patients, and is associated with early tumor recurrence, lymph node metastasis and tamoxifen-resistance. We developed a novel co-culture system to understand the mechanism(s) by which a loss of stromal fibroblast Cav-1 induces a "lethal tumor micro-environment." Here, we propose a new paradigm to explain the powerful prognostic value of stromal Cav-1. In this model, cancer cells induce oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts, which then acts as a "metabolic" and "mutagenic" motor to drive tumor-stroma co-evolution, DNA damage and aneuploidy in cancer cells. More specifically, we show that an acute loss of Cav-1 expression leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and aerobic glycolysis in cancer associated fibroblasts. Also, we propose that defective mitochondria are removed from cancer-associated fibroblasts by autophagy/mitophagy that is induced by oxidative stress. As a consequence, cancer associated fibroblasts provide nutrients (such as lactate) to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism in adjacent cancer cells (the "Reverse Warburg Effect"). We provide evidence that oxidative stress in cancer-associated fibroblasts is sufficient to induce genomic instability in adjacent cancer cells, via a bystander effect, potentially increasing their aggressive behavior. Finally, we directly demonstrate that nitric oxide (NO) over-production, secondary to Cav-1 loss, is the root cause for mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer associated fibroblasts. In support of this notion, treatment with anti-oxidants (such as N-acetyl-cysteine, metformin and quercetin) or NO inhibitors (L-NAME) was sufficient to reverse many of the cancer-associated fibroblast phenotypes that we describe. Thus, cancer cells use "oxidative stress" in adjacent fibroblasts (i) as an "engine" to fuel their own survival via the stromal production of nutrients and (ii) to drive their own mutagenic evolution towards a more aggressive phenotype, by promoting genomic instability. We also present evidence that the "field effect" in cancer biology could also be related to the stromal production of ROS and NO species. eNOS-expressing fibroblasts have the ability to downregulate Cav-1 and induce mitochondrial dysfunction in adjacent fibroblasts that do not express eNOS. As such, the effects of stromal oxidative stress can be laterally propagated, amplified and are effectively "contagious"--spread from cell-to-cell like a virus--creating an "oncogenic/mutagenic" field promoting widespread DNA damage.},

Although many of the metabolic alterations are largely similar to those in normal proliferating cells, they are aberrantly driven in cancer by a combination of genetic lesions and nongenetic factors such as the tumor microenvironment. However, a single model of altered tumor metabolism does not describe the sum of metabolic changes that can support cell growth. Instead, the diversity of such changes within the metabolic program of a cancer cell can dictate by what means proliferative rewiring is driven, and can also impart heterogeneity in the metabolic dependencies of the cell. A better understanding of this heterogeneity may enable the development and optimization of therapeutic strategies that target tumor metabolism.},

CuO NPs (10-100 mg/L) had significant toxicity to A549 cells, whereas CuO bulk particles (BPs) showed much lower toxicity (24 h IC(50), 58 and 15 mg/L for CuO BPs and NPs, respectively). Transmission electron microscopic analysis demonstrated CuO NP entry into A549 cells and organelles, including lysosomes, mitochondria, and nucleus. Endocytosis was the primary pathway of CuO NPs uptake. CuO NPs (15 mg/L) induced mitochondrial depolarization, possibly mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Intracellular CuO NPs first generate ROS, which subsequently induces the expression of p38 and p53 and ultimately causes DNA damage (Comet assay). We confirm for the first time that the primary cytotoxic response is oxidative stress rather than DNA damage. A fraction of the CuO NPs was exported to the extracellular environment. In this study, centrifugal ultrafiltration tubes were successfully employed to determine the dissolved Cu(2+) from CuO NPs in the cell medium. Dissolved Cu(2+) ions contributed less than half of the total toxicity caused by CuO NPs, including ROS generation and DNA damage. This study provided useful data for understanding transport and toxicity of metal oxide NPs in human cells.},

An important source of information for virtual validation is the high number of available cancer datasets. Nevertheless, assessing the prognostic performance of a gene expression signature along datasets is a difficult task for Biologists and Physicians and also time-consuming for Statisticians and Bioinformaticians. Therefore, to facilitate performance comparisons and validations of survival biomarkers for cancer outcomes, we developed SurvExpress, a cancer-wide gene expression database with clinical outcomes and a web-based tool that provides survival analysis and risk assessment of cancer datasets. The main input of SurvExpress is only the biomarker gene list. We generated a cancer database collecting more than 20,000 samples and 130 datasets with censored clinical information covering tumors over 20 tissues. We implemented a web interface to perform biomarker validation and comparisons in this database, where a multivariate survival analysis can be accomplished in about one minute. We show the utility and simplicity of SurvExpress in two biomarker applications for breast and lung cancer. Compared to other tools, SurvExpress is the largest, most versatile, and quickest free tool available.

abstract = {Chromium(VI) (Cr(VI)) is widely used in industry and is a potent inducer of tumors in animals. The present study demonstrates that Cr(VI) induces hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activity through the specific expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ but not HIF-1$\beta$ subunit and increases the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells. To dissect the signaling pathways involved in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1 expression, we found that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was required for HIF-1$\alpha$ expression induced by Cr(VI). Neither phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase nor extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity was required for Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1 expression. Cr(VI) induced expression of HIF-1 and VEGF through the production of reactive oxygen species in DU145 cells. The major species of reactive oxygen species responsible for the induction of HIF-1 and VEGF expression is H2O2. These results suggest that the expression of HIF-1 and VEGF induced by Cr(VI) may be an important signaling pathway in the Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis. Most mutations of human cancer are because of the activation of oncogenes and the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes, which commonly induce new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for tumors to grow beyond a few millimeters in diameter (1, 2). Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)1 is an essential protein for angiogenesis (2, 3). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is a heterodimeric basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, composed of HIF-1$\alpha$ and HIF-1$\beta$/aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator subunits (4). HIF-1$\alpha$ is unique to HIF-1 and is induced exponentially in response to a decrease in cellular O2 concentration (5). HIF-1$\beta$ is identical to the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator that forms a heterodimer with an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (4, 6) and is not regulated by cellular oxygen tension (5). HIF-1 regulates the expression of many genes including VEGF, erythropoietin, heme oxygenase 1, aldolase, enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase A (7). The levels of HIF-1 activity in cells correlate with tumorigenicity and angiogenesis in nude mice (8, 9). HIF-1 is induced by the expression of oncogenes such as v-Src and Ras (8, 10) and is overexpressed in many human cancers (11). Loss of function of HIF-1 results in defects in embryonic vascularization (12, 13). HIF-1$\alpha$ expression, but not HIF-1$\beta$, is induced by growth factors through the activation of PI3K signaling (14, 15). HIF-1 activates the expression of VEGF gene at the transcriptional level (16, 17). VEGF plays a key role in tumor progression and angiogenesis (2, 3). Both inhibition of VEGF expression and the function of its receptor decrease dramatically the tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis in animal models (18-26). Tissue hypoxia is a major inducer for the expression of VEGF in tumors (27,28). Somatic mutations such as oncogene Ras activation and tumor suppressor gene p53 inactivation also increase VEGF expression (10,29-31). Although HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF are implicated in cancer development, the mechanisms of HIF-1$\alpha$ activation and stabilization of HIF-1$\alpha$ protein remain to be studied. The present study investigates Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF in DU145 human prostate carcinoma cells and the role of individual reactive oxygen species (ROS). Cr(VI) is chosen, because it is a well established carcinogen (32). Cr(VI)-containing compounds are widely used in industry under many occupational settings and are found in the environment in the soil and water. Epidemiological studies have shown that workers in the chromate production industry have a consistently high risk for cancer than the general population. Cr(VI) compounds are also potential inducers of tumors in experimental animals (32). Although the mechanisms of Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis are not understood fully, ROS are considered to play an important role (33-39). Previous studies have shown that upon reduction by cellular oxidants, Cr(VI) is able to generate a whole spectrum of ROS, i.e. O Formula , H2O2, and ⋅OH. It is well known that ROS play important roles in carcinogenesis induced by a variety of carcinogens. Through ROS-mediated reaction, Cr(VI) is able to activate p53 and induce apoptosis (37, 39, 40). It has been demonstrated that HIF-1 interacts with p53 and is involved in tumor progression (41-45). It is possible that Cr(VI) may be able to induce the expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF. In the present study, we tested whether Cr(VI) is able to induce expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF. The specific questions were as follows. (a) Is Cr(VI) able to induce HIF-1 and VEGF expression? (b) What are the up-stream signal pathways in Cr(VI)-induced expression of HIF-1$\alpha$ protein? (c) Are ROS species involved in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression? (d) Which species among ROS play the critical roles in Cr(VI)-induced HIF-1$\alpha$ and VEGF expression?},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Efficacy of withaferin A (WA), an Ayurvedic medicine constituent, for prevention of mammary cancer and its associated mechanisms were investigated using mouse mammary tumor virus-neu (MMTV-neu) transgenic model.

METHODS: Incidence and burden of mammary cancer and pulmonary metastasis were scored in female MMTV-neu mice after 28 weeks of intraperitoneal administration with 100 µg WA (three times/week) (n = 32) or vehicle (n = 29). Mechanisms underlying mammary cancer prevention by WA were investigated by determination of tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolomics, and proteomics using plasma and/or tumor tissues. Spectrophotometric assays were performed to determine activities of complex III and complex IV. All statistical tests were two-sided.

RESULTS: WA administration resulted in a statistically significant decrease in macroscopic mammary tumor size, microscopic mammary tumor area, and the incidence of pulmonary metastasis. For example, the mean area of invasive cancer was lower by 95.14{\%} in the WA treatment group compared with the control group (mean = 3.10 vs 63.77 mm2, respectively; difference = -60.67 mm2; 95{\%} confidence interval = -122.50 to 1.13 mm2; P = .0536). Mammary cancer prevention by WA treatment was associated with increased apoptosis, inhibition of complex III activity, and reduced levels of glycolysis intermediates. Proteomics confirmed downregulation of many glycolysis-related proteins in the tumor of WA-treated mice compared with control, including M2-type pyruvate kinase, phospho glycerate kinase, and fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A isoform 2.

CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals suppression of glycolysis in WA-mediated mammary cancer prevention in a clinically relevant mouse model.},

abstract = {The aim of this present study is firstly to compare significant predictors of mortality for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing resection between artificial neural network (ANN) and logistic regression (LR) models and secondly to evaluate the predictive accuracy of ANN and LR in different survival year estimation models. We constructed a prognostic model for 434 patients with 21 potential input variables by Cox regression model. Model performance was measured by numbers of significant predictors and predictive accuracy. The results indicated that ANN had double to triple numbers of significant predictors at 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival models as compared with LR models. Scores of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival estimation models using ANN were superior to those of LR in all the training sets and most of the validation sets. The study demonstrated that ANN not only had a great number of predictors of mortality variables but also provided accurate prediction, as compared with conventional methods. It is suggested that physicians consider using data mining methods as supplemental tools for clinical decision-making and prognostic evaluation.},

@article{Resendis-Antonio2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations on glucose consumption and biosynthetic activity of amino acids, lipids and nucleotides are metabolic changes for sustaining cell proliferation in cancer cells. Irrevocable evidence of this fact is the Warburg effect which establishes that cancer cells prefers glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Regulatory action over metabolic enzymes has opened a new window for designing more effective anti-cancer treatments. This enterprise is not trivial and the development of computational models that contribute to identifying potential enzymes for breaking the robustness of cancer cells is a priority.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This work presents a constraint-base modeling of the most experimentally studied metabolic pathways supporting cancer cells: glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate, glutaminolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. To evaluate its predictive capacities, a growth kinetics study for Hela cell lines was accomplished and qualitatively compared with in silico predictions. Furthermore, based on pure computational criteria, we concluded that a set of enzymes (such as lactate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase) perform a pivotal role in cancer cell growth, findings supported by an experimental counterpart.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Alterations on metabolic activity are crucial to initiate and sustain cancer phenotype. In this work, we analyzed the phenotype capacities emerged from a constructed metabolic network conformed by the most experimentally studied pathways sustaining cancer cell growth. Remarkably, in silico model was able to resemble the physiological conditions in cancer cells and successfully identified some enzymes currently studied by its therapeutic effect. Overall, we supplied evidence that constraint-based modeling constitutes a promising computational platform to: 1) integrate high throughput technology and establish a crosstalk between experimental validation and in silico prediction in cancer cell phenotype; 2) explore the fundamental metabolic mechanism that confers robustness in cancer; and 3) suggest new metabolic targets for anticancer treatments. All these issues being central to explore cancer cell metabolism from a systems biology perspective.},

@article{Gagnon2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: C-reactive protein (CRP) is gaining credibility as a prognostic factor in different cancers. Cox's proportional hazard (PH) model is usually used to assess prognostic factors. However, this model imposes a priori assumptions, which are rarely tested, that (1) the hazard ratio associated with each prognostic factor remains constant across the follow-up (PH assumption) and (2) the relationship between a continuous predictor and the logarithm of the mortality hazard is linear (linearity assumption).

METHODS: We tested these two assumptions of the Cox's PH model for CRP, using a flexible statistical model, while adjusting for other known prognostic factors, in a cohort of 269 patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

RESULTS: In the Cox's PH model, high CRP increased the risk of death (HR=1.11 per each doubling of CRP value, 95{\%} CI: 1.03-1.20, P=0.008). However, both the PH assumption (P=0.033) and the linearity assumption (P=0.015) were rejected for CRP, measured at the initiation of chemotherapy, which kept its prognostic value for approximately 18 months.

CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that flexible modeling provides new insights regarding the value of CRP as a prognostic factor in NSCLC and that Cox's PH model underestimates early risks associated with high CRP.},

At a molecular level, TRIM24 is a negative regulator of p53 levels and a co-activator of estrogen receptor. However, the role of TRIM24 in breast tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. We used an isogenic human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC) culture model, derived from reduction mammoplasty tissue, and found that ectopic expression of TRIM24 in immortalized HMECs (TRIM24 iHMECs) greatly increased cellular proliferation and induced malignant transformation. Subcutaneous injection of TRIM24 iHMECs in nude mice led to growth of intermediate to high-grade tumors in 60-70{\%} of mice. Molecular analysis of TRIM24 iHMECs revealed a glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid cycle gene signature, alongside increased glucose uptake and activated aerobic glycolysis. Collectively, these results identify a role for TRIM24 in breast tumorigenesis through reprogramming of glucose metabolism in HMECs, further supporting TRIM24 as a viable therapeutic target in breast cancer.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 July 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.220.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) is an insulin facilitated glucose transporter that plays an important role in maintaining blood glucose homeostasis. GLUT4 is sequestered into intracellular vesicles in unstimulated cells and translocated to the plasma membrane by various stimuli. Understanding the structural details of GLUT4 will provide insights into the mechanism of glucose transport and its regulation. To date, a crystal structure for GLUT4 is not available. However, earlier work from our laboratory proposed a well validated homology model for GLUT4 based on the experimental data available on GLUT1 and the crystal structure data obtained from the glycerol 3-phosphate transporter. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, the dynamic behavior of GLUT4 in a membrane environment was analyzed using three forms of GLUT4 (apo, substrate and ATP-substrate bound states). Apo form simulation analysis revealed an extracellular open conformation of GLUT4 in the membrane favoring easy exofacial binding of substrate. Simulation studies with the substrate bound form proposed a stable state of GLUT4 with glucose, which can be a substrate-occluded state of the transporter. Principal component analysis suggested a clockwise movement for the domains in the apo form, whereas ATP substrate-bound form induced an anti-clockwise rotation. Simulation studies suggested distinct conformational changes for the GLUT4 domains in the ATP substrate-bound form and favor a constricted behavior for the transport channel. Various inter-domain hydrogen bonds and switching of a salt-bridge network from E345-R350-E409 to E345-R169-E409 contributed to this ATP-mediated channel constriction favoring substrate occlusion and prevention of its release into cytoplasm. These data are consistent with the biochemical studies, suggesting an inhibitory role for ATP in GLUT-mediated glucose transport. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In the absence of a crystal structure for any glucose transporter, this study provides mechanistic details of the conformational changes in GLUT4 induced by substrate and its regulator.},

abstract = {Purpose: The goals of this study were to investigate the clinical activity, safety, and biomarkers of dacomitinib, an irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR, HER2, and HER4, in recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M-SCCHN). Experimental Design: Patients were eligible if the diseases were not amenable to curative treatment and had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy, and were treated with dacomitinib 45 mg/day. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by RECISTv1.1. Exploratory analysis included the characterization of somatic mutation, gene copy number, gene expression, p16INK4A expression by IHC, and investigation of their relationship with clinical outcomes. Results: Forty-eight patients were evaluable for efficacy and toxicity. Ten patients (20.8{\%}) had partial responses and 31 patients (65{\%}) had stable diseases. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 3.9 months [95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 2.9-5.0] and 6.6 months (95{\%} CI, 5.4-10.3). Adverse events were mostly grade 1-2. Mutations in the PI3K pathway (PIK3CA, PTEN) and high expression of inflammatory cytokines (IL6, IL8, IL1A, IL1B, IL4, and TNF) were significantly associated with shorter PFS (2.9 vs. 4.9 months without mutations, P = 0.013; 2.8 vs. 9.9 months with low expression, P = 0.004). Those harboring PI3K pathway mutations or high inflammatory cytokine expression had shorter median OS (6.1 vs. 12.5 months lacking PI3K pathway mutations and with low inflammatory cytokine expression, P = 0.005). Conclusions: Dacomitinib demonstrated clinical efficacy with manageable toxicity in platinum-failed R/M-SCCHN patients. Screening of PI3K pathway mutation and inflammatory cytokine expression may help identify which R/M-SCCHN patients are likely to gain benefit from dacomitinib. Clin Cancer Res; 21(3); 544-52.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, considerable attention has been given to the development of sophisticated techniques for exploring data sets. One such class of techniques is artificial neural networks (ANNs). Artificial neural networks have many attractive theoretic properties, specifically, the ability to detect non predefined relations such as nonlinear effects and/or interactions. These theoretic advantages come at the cost of reduced interpretability of the model output. Many authors have analyzed the same data set, based on these factors, with both standard statistical methods (such as logistic or Cox regression) and ANN.

METHODS: The goal of this work is to review the literature comparing the performance of ANN with standard statistical techniques when applied to medium to large data sets (sample size {\textgreater} 200 patients). A thorough literature search was performed, with specific criteria for a published comparison to be included in this review.

RESULTS: In the 28 studies included in this review, ANN outperformed regression in 10 cases (36{\%}), was outperformed by regression in 4 cases (14{\%}), and the 2 methods had similar performance in the remaining 14 cases (50{\%}). However, in the 8 largest studies (sample size {\textgreater} 5000), regression and ANN tied in 7 cases, with regression winning in the remaining case. In addition, there is some suggestion of publication bias.

CONCLUSIONS: Neither method achieves the desired performance. Both methods should continue to be used and explored in a complementary manner. However, based on the available data, ANN should not replace standard statistical approaches as the method of choice for the classification of medical data.},

abstract = {The increased migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells are key events in the development of metastasis to the lymph nodes and distant organs. Although the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand, stromal cell-derived factor-1$\alpha$, have been found to play an important role in tumor invasion, its precise role and potential underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we showed that knockdown of CXCR4 significantly decreased Tca8113 cells migration and invasion, accompanied with the reduction of MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression. Inhibition of ligand binding to CXCR4 by a specific antagonist TN14003, also led to reduced cancer cell migration and invasion. Because the degradation of the extracellular matrix and the basement membrane by proteases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) is critical for migration and invasion of cancer cells, we investigated the expression of several MMPs and found that the expression of functional MMP-9 and MMP-13 was selectively decreased in CXCR4 knockdown cells. More importantly, decreased cell migration and invasion of CXCR4 knockdown cells were completely rescued by exogenous expression of MMP-9 or MMP-13, indicating that the two MMPs are downstream targets of CXCR4-mediated signaling. Furthermore, we found the level of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was significantly decreased in CXCR4-silenced cells, suggesting that ERK may be a potential mediator of CXCR4-regulated MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression in Tca8113 cells. Taken together, our results strongly suggest the underlying mechanism of CXCR4 promoting Tca8113 migration and invasion by regulating MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression perhaps via activation of the ERK signaling pathway.},

abstract = {Activation of the adipose renin-angiotensin system contributes to the development of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) has been identified a key regulator of GLUT4 transporter as well as angiotensin IV (AngIV) receptor (AT4R). Although AngII-AT1R axis appears as anorexigenic and as an effector of energy expenditure, the impact of AngIV-IRAP/AT4R axis on energy metabolism remains unknown. The aim was to determine the role of IRAP in energy metabolism in mice METHODS AND RESULTS: In adipocyte culture, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) expression levels were diminished in IRAP knockout (IRAP(-/-)) if compared with those of wild-type (C57Bl/6J, WT) mice. Mice were fed high-fat diet (32{\%} fat) at age of 8 weeks. At the entry, body weight, body fat content, and parameters of saccharometabolism were similar between groups. However, IRAP(-/-) mice exhibited blunted body weight gain compared to that of WT mice, despite comparable food intake and physical activity. At 20 weeks of age, IRAP(-/-) mice had 25{\%} lower body weight than WT mice. Glucose and insulin tolerance tests revealed that the glucose disposal and the hypoglycemic effect of insulin were pronounced in IRAP(-/-) mice after a high fat diet. Indirect calorimetry demonstrated that whole-body oxygen consumption rates were significantly higher in IRAP(-/-) mice by 18{\%} with mild hyperthermia. Analysis of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in IRAP(-/-) showed increased levels of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) at basal level and adaptive thermogenesis was not impaired.

CONCLUSIONS: IRAP deficiency may leads to suppression of PAI-1 expression in adipocytes and upregulation of UCP-1-mediated thermogenesis in BAT and increased energy expenditure to prevent the development of obesity, and suggest a therapeutic potential of IRAP/AT4R blockade in diet-induced obesity.},

A combination of the irreversible TKI afatinib and the EGFR antibody cetuximab can be used to overcome resistance to first-generation TKIs; however, resistance to this drug combination eventually emerges. We identified activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway as a mechanism of resistance to dual inhibition of EGFR in mouse models. The addition of rapamycin reversed resistance in vivo. Analysis of afatinib-plus-cetuximab-resistant biopsy specimens revealed the presence of genomic alterations in genes that modulate mTORC1 signaling, including NF2 and TSC1. These findings pinpoint enhanced mTORC1 activation as a mechanism of resistance to afatinib plus cetuximab and identify genomic mechanisms that lead to activation of this pathway, revealing a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with resistance to these drugs.},

abstract = {Stevioside from Stevia rebaudiana has been reported to exert antihyperglycemic effects in both rat and human subjects. There have been few studies on these effects in vitro. In this paper, radioactive glucose uptake assay was implemented in order to assess improvements in insulin sensitivity in 3T3-L1 cells by elevation of glucose uptake following treatment with stevioside. Oil Red-O staining and MTT assay were utilized to confirm adipocyte differentiation and cell viability, respectively. Findings from this research showed a significant increase in absorbance values in mature adipocytes following Oil Red-O staining, confirming the differentiation process. Stevioside was noncytotoxic to 3T3-L1 cells as cell viability was reduced by a maximum of 17{\%}, making it impossible to determine its IC50. Stevioside increased glucose uptake activities by 2.1 times (p {\textless} 0.001) in normal conditions and up to 4.4 times (p {\textless} 0.001) in insulin-resistant states. At times, this increase was higher than that seen in positive control group treated with rosiglitazone maleate, an antidiabetic agent. Expressions of pY20 and p-IRS1 which were measured via Western blot were improved by stevioside treatment. In conclusion, stevioside has direct effects on 3T3-L1 insulin sensitivity via increase in glucose uptake and enhanced expression of proteins involved in insulin-signalling pathway.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Lactate was previously shown to be a prognostic but not a predictive pre-therapeutic marker for radiation response of tumor xenografts. We hypothesize that metabolic changes during fractionated irradiation may restrict the predictiveness of lactate regarding tumor radiosensitivity.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor xenografts were generated in nude mice by implanting 4 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines with different sensitivities to fractionated irradiation. Tumors were irradiated with up to 15 fractions of 2 Gy over a period of 3 weeks, and ATP and lactate levels were measured in vital tumor areas with induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging. Corresponding changes in mRNA expression of glycolysis-related genes were determined by quantitative RT-PCR.

RESULTS: Lactate content decreased significantly in 3 out of 4 cell lines in the course of irradiation showing no correlation with cell line-specific radiosensitivity. Radiation-induced changes in ATP levels and glycolysis-related mRNA expression, however, only occurred in radiosensitive or intermediately radioresistant xenografts, whereas these parameters remained unchanged in radioresistant tumors.

CONCLUSION: Sensitivity-related differences in the transcriptional response of tumors to radiotherapy may be exploited in the clinic for better individualization of tumor treatment.},

@article{Cordero-Espinoza2013,
abstract = {Unlike normal differentiated cells, tumor cells metabolize glucose via glycolysis under aerobic conditions, a hallmark of cancer known as the Warburg effect. Cells lacking the commonly mutated tumor suppressor PTEN exhibit a glycolytic phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. This has been traditionally attributed to the hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling that results from PTEN loss. Here, we propose a novel mechanism whereby the loss of PTEN negatively affects the activity of the E3 ligase APC/C-Cdh1, resulting in the stabilization of the enzyme PFKFB3 and increased synthesis of its product fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6P2). We discovered that when compared with wild-type cells, PTEN knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PTEN KO MEF) have 2-3-fold higher concentrations of F2,6P2, the most potent allosteric activator of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1). Reintroduction of either wild-type or phosphatase mutant PTEN in the PTEN KO cells effectively lowers F2,6P2 to the wild-type levels and reduces their lactate production. PTEN KO cells were found to have high protein levels of PFKFB3, which directly contribute to the increased concentrations of F2,6P2. PTEN enhances interaction between PFKFB3 and Cdh1, and overexpression of Cdh1 down-regulates the PFKFB3 protein level in wild-type, but not in PTEN-deficient cells. Importantly, we found that the degradation of endogenous PFKFB3 in PTEN KO cells occurs at a slower rate than in wild-type cells. Our results suggest an important role for F2,6P2 in the metabolic reprogramming of PTEN-deficient cells that has important consequences for cell proliferation.},

abstract = {The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is frequently activated in human cancer and represents an attractive target for therapies based on small molecule inhibitors. PI3K isoforms play an essential role in the signal transduction events activated by cell surface receptors including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are eight known PI3K isoforms in humans, which have been subdivided into three classes (I-III). Therefore PI3Ks show considerable diversity and it remains unclear which kinases in this family should be targeted in cancer. The class I(A) of PI3K comprises the p110alpha, p110beta and p110delta isoforms, which associate with activated RTKs. In human cancer, recent reports have described activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene encoding p110alpha, and inactivating mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) gene, a tumour suppressor and antagonist of the PI3K pathway. The PIK3CA mutations described in cancer constitutively activate p110alpha and, when expressed in cells drive oncogenic transformation. Moreover, these mutations cause the constitutive activation of downstream signaling molecules such as Akt/protein kinase B (PKB), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) that is commonly observed in cancer cells. In addition to p110alpha, the other isoforms of the PI3K family may also play a role in human cancer, although their individual functions remain to be precisely identified. In this review we will discuss the evidence implicating individual PI3K isoforms in human cancer and their potential as drug targets in this context.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE While maintaining cardiac performance, chronic $\beta$-adrenoceptor activation eventually exacerbates the progression of cardiac remodelling and failure. We examined the adverse signalling pathways mediated by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and reactive oxygen species (ROS) after chronic $\beta$2-adrenoceptor activation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Mice with transgenic $\beta$2-adrenoceptor overexpression ($\beta$2-TG) and non-transgenic littermates were either untreated or treated with an antioxidant (N-acetylcysteine, NAC) or NADPH oxidase inhibitors (apocynin, diphenyliodonium). Levels of ROS, phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen content in the left ventricle (LV) and LV function were measured and compared. KEY RESULTS $\beta$2-TG mice showed increased ROS production, phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen, and progressive ventricular dysfunction. $\beta$2-adrenoceptor stimulation similarly increased ROS production and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27 in cultured cardiomyocytes. Treatment with apocynin, diphenyliodonium or NAC reduced phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and HSP27 in both cultured cardiomyocytes and the LV of $\beta$2-TG mice. NAC treatment (500 mg{\textperiodcentered}kg−1{\textperiodcentered}day−1) for 2 weeks eliminated the up-regulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and collagen in the LV of $\beta$2-TG mice. Chronic NAC treatment to $\beta$2-TG mice from 7 to 10 months of age largely prevented progression of ventricular dilatation, preserved contractile function (fractional shortening 37 ± 5{\%} vs. 25 ± 3{\%}, ejection fraction 52 ± 5{\%} vs. 32 ± 4{\%}, both P {\textless} 0.05), reduced cardiac fibrosis and suppressed matrix metalloproteinase activity. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS $\beta$2-adrenoceptor stimulation provoked NADPH oxidase-derived ROS production in the heart. Elevated ROS activated p38 MAPK and contributed significantly to cardiac inflammation, remodelling and failure.},

METHODS: A 7-year retrospective study of 1134 invasive breast cancer subjects. Clinical and pathologic features and survival of the four subtypes were compared.

RESULTS: Using ER/PR+ and Her2- as a reference, ER/PR-, Her2- had the worst overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.8; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.06-3.2) and the worst disease-free survival (hazard ratio, 1.5; 95{\%} CI, 0.8-3.0). In ER/PR+, Her2-, chemotherapy conferred significant overall and disease-free survival advantages. Subtype comparison revealed statistically significant differences in outcomes.

CONCLUSION: The triple negative subtype has the worst overall and disease free survival. Efforts should be directed at standardization of current testing methods and development of more reliable and reproducible testing.},

abstract = {Silybin, the major flavonoid of Silybum marianum, is widely used to treat liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis-associated insulin resistance. Research so far has focused on its anti-oxidant properties. Here, we demonstrate that silybin and its derivative dehydrosilybin inhibit glucose uptake in several model systems. Both flavonoids dose-dependently reduce basal and insulin-dependent glucose uptake of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with dehydrosilybin showing significantly stronger inhibition. However, insulin signaling was not impaired, and immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation showed that insulin-induced translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is also unchanged. Likewise, hexokinase activity was not affected suggesting that silybin and dehydrosilybin interfere directly with glucose transport across the PM. Expression of GLUT4 in CHO cells counteracted the inhibition of glucose uptake by both flavonoids. Moreover, treatment of CHO cells with silybin and dehydrosilybin reduced cell viability which was partially rescued by GLUT4 expression. Kinetic analysis revealed that silybin and dehydrosilybin inhibit GLUT4-mediated glucose transport in a competitive manner with K(i)=60 and 116 µM, respectively. We conclude that silybin and dehydrosilybin inhibit cellular glucose uptake by directly interacting with GLUT transporters. Glucose starvation offers a novel explanation for the anti-cancer effects of silybin.},

abstract = {Oxygen-sensitive accumulation and degradation, two opposite but intrinsically linked events, of heme proteins in mitochondria affect mitochondrial functions, including bioenergetics and oxygen-sensing processes. Cystathionine $\beta$-synthase (CBS) contains a prosthetic heme group and catalyzes the production of hydrogen sulfide in mammalian cells. Here we show that CBS proteins were present in liver mitochondria at a low level under normoxia conditions. Ischemia/hypoxia increased the accumulation of CBS proteins in mitochondria. The normalization of oxygen partial pressure accelerated the degradation of CBS proteins. Lon protease, a major degradation enzyme in mitochondrial matrix, recognized and degraded mitochondrial CBS by specifically targeting at the oxygenated heme group of CBS proteins. The accumulation of CBS in mitochondria increased hydrogen sulfide production, which prevented Ca(2+)-mediated cytochrome c release from mitochondria and decreased reactive oxygen species generation. Mitochondrial accumulation of heme oxygenase-1, another heme protein, was also regulated by oxygen level and Lon protease in the same mechanism as for CBS. Our findings provide a fundamental and general mechanism for oxygen-sensitive regulation of mitochondrial functions by linking oxygenation level to the accumulation/degradation of mitochondrial heme proteins.},

abstract = {Glucose is the major energy source for mammalian cells as well as an important substrate for protein and lipid synthesis. Mammalian cells take up glucose from extracellular fluid into the cell through two families of structurallyrelated glucose transporters. The facilitative glucose transporter family (solute carriers SLC2A, protein symbol GLUT) mediates a bidirectional and energy-independent process of glucose transport in most tissues and cells, while the NaM(+)/glucose cotransporter family (solute carriers SLC5A, protein symbol SGLT) mediates an active, Na(+)-linked transport process against an electrochemical gradient. The GLUT family consists of thirteen members (GLUT1-12 and HMIT). Phylogenetically, the members of the GLUT family are split into three classes based on protein similarities. Up to now, at least six members of the SGLT family have been cloned (SGLT1-6). In this review, we report both the genomic structure and function of each transporter as well as intra-species comparative genomic analysis of some of these transporters. The affinity for glucose and transport kinetics of each transporter differs and ranges from 0.2 to 17mM. The ability of each protein to transport alternative substrates also differs and includes substrates such as fructose and galactose. In addition, the tissue distribution pattern varies between species. There are different regulation mechanisms of these transporters. Characterization of transcriptional control of some of the gene promoters has been investigated and alternative promoter usage to generate different protein isoforms has been demonstrated. We also introduce some pathophysiological roles of these transporters in human.},

abstract = {The mechanism for how metformin activates AMPK (AMP-activated kinase) was investigated in isolated skeletal muscle L6 cells. A widely held notion is that inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is central to the mechanism. We also considered other proposals for metformin action. As metabolic pathway markers, we focused on glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. We also confirmed metformin actions on other metabolic processes in L6 cells. Metformin stimulated both glucose transport and fatty acid oxidation. The mitochondrial Complex I inhibitor rotenone also stimulated glucose transport but it inhibited fatty acid oxidation, independently of metformin. The peroxynitrite generator 3-morpholinosydnonimine stimulated glucose transport, but inhibited fatty acid oxidation. Addition of the nitric oxide precursor arginine to cells did not affect glucose transport. These studies differentiate metformin from inhibition of mitochondrial respiration and from active nitrogen species. Knockdown of adenylate kinase also failed to affect metformin stimulation of glucose transport. Hence, any means of increase in ADP appears not to be involved in the metformin mechanism. Knockdown of LKB1, an upstream kinase and AMPK activator, did not affect metformin action. Having ruled out existing proposals, we suggest a new one: metformin might increase AMP through inhibition of AMP deaminase (AMPD). We found that metformin inhibited purified AMP deaminase activity. Furthermore, a known inhibitor of AMPD stimulated glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation. Both metformin and the AMPD inhibitor suppressed ammonia accumulation by the cells. Knockdown of AMPD obviated metformin stimulation of glucose transport. We conclude that AMPD inhibition is the mechanism of metformin action.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents. The survival rate of patients with metastatic disease remains very dismal. Nevertheless, metastasis is a complex process and a single-level analysis is not likely to identify its key biological determinants. In this study, we used a systems biology approach to identify common metastatic pathways that are jointly supported by both mRNA and protein expression data in two distinct human metastatic OS models.

RESULTS: mRNA expression microarray and N-linked glycoproteomic analyses were performed on two commonly used isogenic pairs of human metastatic OS cell lines, namely HOS/143B and SaOS-2/LM7. Pathway analysis of the differentially regulated genes and glycoproteins separately revealed pathways associated to metastasis including cell cycle regulation, immune response, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition. However, no common significant pathway was found at both genomic and proteomic levels between the two metastatic models, suggesting a very different biological nature of the cell lines. To address this issue, we used a topological significance analysis based on a "shortest-path" algorithm to identify topological nodes, which uncovered additional biological information with respect to the genomic and glycoproteomic profiles but remained hidden from the direct analyses. Pathway analysis of the significant topological nodes revealed a striking concordance between the models and identified significant common pathways, including "Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT", "Cytoskeleton remodeling/Cytoskeleton remodeling", and "Cell adhesion/Chemokines and adhesion". Of these, the "Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT" was the top ranked common pathway from the topological analysis of the genomic and proteomic profiles in the two metastatic models. The up-regulation of proteins in the "Cytoskeleton remodeling/TGF/WNT" pathway in the SaOS-2/LM7 and HOS/143B models was further validated using an orthogonal Reverse Phase Protein Array platform.

CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we used a systems biology approach by integrating genomic and proteomic data to identify key and common metastatic mechanisms in OS. The use of the topological analysis revealed hidden biological pathways that are known to play critical roles in metastasis. Wnt signaling has been previously implicated in OS and other tumors, and inhibitors of Wnt signaling pathways are available for clinical testing. Further characterization of this common pathway and other topological pathways identified from this study may lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastatic OS.},

abstract = {The focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a key regulator of cell migration. Phosphorylation at Tyr-397 activates FAK and creates a binding site for Src family kinases. FAK phosphorylates the cytoskeletal protein alpha-actinin at Tyr-12. Here we report that protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP 1B) is an alpha-actinin phosphatase. PTP 1B-dependent dephosphorylation of alpha-actinin was seen in COS-7 cells and PTP 1B-null fibroblasts reconstituted with PTP 1B. Furthermore, we show that coexpression of wild-type alpha-actinin and PTP 1B causes dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK. No dephosphorylation was observed in cells coexpressing the alpha-actinin phosphorylation mutant Y12F and PTP 1B. Furthermore, the phosphorylation at four other sites in FAK was not altered by PTP 1B. In addition, we found that phosphorylated alpha-actinin bound to Src and reduced the binding of FAK to Src. The dephosphorylation at Tyr-397 in FAK triggered by wild-type alpha-actinin and PTP 1B caused a significant increase in cell migration. We propose that phosphorylated alpha-actinin disrupts the FAK x Src complex exposing Tyr-397 in FAK to PTP 1B. These findings uncover a novel feedback loop involving phosphorylated alpha-actinin and PTP 1B that regulates FAK x Src interaction and cell migration.},

abstract = {AS160 (TBC1D4) is a known Akt substrate that is phosphorylated downstream of insulin action and that leads to regulated traffic of GLUT4. As GLUT4 vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is a highly regulated step in GLUT4 traffic, we investigated whether AS160 and 14-3-3 interactions are involved in this process. Fusion was inhibited by a human truncated AS160 variant that encompasses the first N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domain, by either of the two N-terminal PTB domains, and by a tandem construct of both PTB domains of rat AS160. We also found that in vitro GLUT4 vesicle fusion was strongly inhibited by the 14-3-3-quenching inhibitors R18 and fusicoccin. To investigate the mode of interaction of AS160 and 14-3-3, we examined insulin-dependent increases in the levels of these proteins on GLUT4 vesicles. 14-3-3$\gamma$ was enriched on insulin-stimulated vesicles, and its binding to AS160 on GLUT4 vesicles was inhibited by the AS160 tandem PTB domain construct. These data suggest a model for PTB domain action on GLUT4 vesicle fusion in which these constructs inhibit insulin-stimulated 14-3-3$\gamma$ interaction with AS160 rather than AS160 phosphorylation.},

This phenomenon clearly indicates that lactate is not a surrogate of tumor hypoxia. Tumor lactate can predict for metastases and overall survival of patients, as shown by several studies of different entities. Metastasis of tumors is promoted by lactate-induced secretion of hyaluronan by tumor-associated fibroblasts that create a milieu favorable for migration. Lactate itself has been found to induce the migration of cells and cell clusters. Furthermore, radioresistance has been positively correlated with lactate concentrations, suggesting an antioxidative capacity of lactate. Findings on interactions of tumor metabolites with immune cells indicate a contribution of lactate to the immune escape. Furthermore, lactate bridges the gap between high lactate levels in wound healing, chronic inflammation, and cancer development. Tumor cells ensure sufficient oxygen and nutrient supply for proliferation through lactate-induced secretion of VEGF, resulting in the formation of new vessels. In summary, accumulation of lactate in solid tumors is a pivotal and early event in the development of malignancies. The determination of lactate should enter further clinical trials to confirm its relevance in cancer biology.},

abstract = {A new molecular mathematical model is developed by considering the kinetics of GLUT2, GLUT3, and GLUT4, the process of glucose mobilization by glycogen phosphorylase and glycogen synthase in liver, and the dynamics of the insulin signaling pathway. The new model can qualitatively reproduce the experimental glucose and insulin data. It also enables us to use the Bendixson criterion about the existence of periodic orbits of a two-dimensional dynamical system to mathematically predict that the oscillations of glucose and insulin are not caused by liver, instead they would be caused by the mechanism of insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Furthermore it enables us to conduct a parametric sensitivity analysis. The analysis shows that both glucose and insulin are most sensitive to the rate constant for conversion of PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2), the multiplicative factor modulating the rate constant for conversion of PI(3,4,5)P(3) to PI(4,5)P(2), the multiplicative factor that modulates insulin receptor dephosphorylation rate, and the maximum velocity of GLUT4. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis predicts that an increase of the apparent velocity of GLUT4, a combination of elevated mobilization rate of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane and an extended duration of GLUT4 on the plasma membrane, will result in a decrease in the needs of plasma insulin. On the other hand, an increase of the GLUT4 internalization rate results in an elevated demand of insulin to stimulate the mobilization of GLUT4 from the intracellular store to the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that hyperinsulinemia may increase the cancer risk. Moreover, many tumors demonstrate an increased activation of IR signaling pathways. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is necessary for insulin action. In epithelial cells, which do not express GLUT4 and gluconeogenic enzymes, insulin-mediated PI3K activation regulates cell survival, growth, and motility. Although the involvement of the regulatory subunit of PI3K (p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)) in insulin signal transduction has been extensively studied, the function of its N-terminus remains elusive. It has been identified as a serine (S83) in the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K) that is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA). To determine the molecular mechanism linking PKA to insulin-mediated PI3K activation, we used p85$\alpha$ (PI3K) mutated forms to prevent phosphorylation (p85A) or to mimic the phosphorylated residue (p85D). We demonstrated that phosphorylation of p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)S83 modulates the formation of the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)/IRS-1 complex and its subcellular localization influencing the kinetics of the insulin signaling both on MAPK-ERK and AKT pathways. Furthermore, the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)S83 phosphorylation plays a central role in the control of insulin-mediated cell proliferation, cell migration, and adhesion. This study highlights the p85$\alpha$ (PI3K)S83 role as a key regulator of cell proliferation and motility induced by insulin in MCF-7 cells breast cancer model.},

abstract = {Besides being the favorite carbon and energy source for the budding yeast Sacchromyces cerevisiae, glucose can act as a signaling molecule to regulate multiple aspects of yeast physiology. Yeast cells have evolved several mechanisms for monitoring the level of glucose in their habitat and respond quickly to frequent changes in the sugar availability in the environment: the cAMP/PKA pathways (with its two branches comprising Ras and the Gpr1/Gpa2 module), the Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway and the main repression pathway involving the kinase Snf1. The cAMP/PKA pathway plays the prominent role in responding to changes in glucose availability and initiating the signaling processes that promote cell growth and division. Snf1 (the yeast homologous to mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase) is primarily required for the adaptation of yeast cell to glucose limitation and for growth on alternative carbon source, but it is also involved in the cellular response to various environmental stresses. The Rgt2/Snf3-Rgt1 pathway regulates the expression of genes required for glucose uptake. Many interconnections exist between the diverse glucose sensing systems, which enables yeast cells to fine tune cell growth, cell cycle and their coordination in response to nutritional changes.},

abstract = {Cigarette smoke (CS) increases chemokine production in lung epithelial cells (LECs), but the pathways involved are not completely understood. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a crucial regulator of energy homeostasis, may modulate inflammation. Here, we show that cigarette smoke extract sequentially activated NADPH oxidase; increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level; activated AMPK, NF-$\kappa$B, and STAT3; and induced interleukin 8 (IL-8) in human LECs. Inhibition of NADPH oxidase activation by apocynin or siRNA targeting p47(phox) (a subunit of NADPH oxidase) attenuated the increased intracellular ROS level, AMPK activation, and IL-8 induction. Removal of intracellular ROS by N-acetylcysteine reduced the AMPK activation and IL-8 induction. Prevention of AMPK activation by Compound C or AMPK siRNA lessened the activation of both NF-$\kappa$B and STAT3 and the induction of IL-8. Abrogation of the activation of NF-$\kappa$B and STAT3 by BAY11-7085 and AG490, respectively, attenuated the IL-8 induction. We additionally show that chronic CS exposure in mice promoted AMPK phosphorylation and expression of MIP-2$\alpha$ (an IL-8 homolog) in LECs and lungs, as well as lung inflammation, all of which were reduced by Compound C treatment. Thus, a novel NADPH oxidase-dependent, ROS-sensitive AMPK signaling is important for CS-induced IL-8 production in LECs and possibly lung inflammation.},

@article{Masin2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alterations in glucose metabolism and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) constitute two important characteristics of carcinoma progression toward invasive cancer. Despite an extensive characterization of each of them separately, the links between EMT and glucose metabolism of tumor cells remain elusive. Here we show that the neuronal glucose transporter GLUT3 contributes to glucose uptake and proliferation of lung tumor cells that have undergone an EMT.

RESULTS: Using a panel of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we demonstrate that GLUT3 is strongly expressed in mesenchymal, but not epithelial cells, a finding corroborated in hepatoma cells. Furthermore, we identify that ZEB1 binds to the GLUT3 gene to activate transcription. Importantly, inhibiting GLUT3 expression reduces glucose import and the proliferation of mesenchymal lung tumor cells, whereas ectopic expression in epithelial cells sustains proliferation in low glucose. Using a large microarray data collection of human NSCLCs, we determine that GLUT3 expression correlates with EMT markers and is prognostic of poor overall survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results reveal that GLUT3 is a transcriptional target of ZEB1 and that this glucose transporter plays an important role in lung cancer, when tumor cells loose their epithelial characteristics to become more invasive. Moreover, these findings emphasize the development of GLUT3 inhibitory drugs as a targeted therapy for the treatment of patients with poorly differentiated tumors.},

@article{McIntyre2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The tumor-specific EGFR deletion mutant, EGFRvIII, is characterised by ligand-independent constitutive signalling. Tumors expressing EGFRvIII are resistant to current EGFR-targeted therapy. The frequency of EGFRvIII in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is disputed and may vary by specific sub-site. The purpose of this study was to measure the occurrence of EGFRvIII mutations in a specific HNSCC subsite, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), using a novel real-time PCR assay.

METHODOLOGY: Pre-treatment Formalin Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) cancer specimens from 50 OSCC patients were evaluated for the presence of EGFRvIII using a novel hydrolysis probe-based real-time PCR assay. EGFR protein expression in tumor samples was quantified using fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) and AQUA{\textregistered} technology.

PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We detected EGFRvIII in a single OSCC patient in our cohort (2{\%}). We confirmed the validity of our detection technique in an independent cohort of glioblastoma patients. We also compared the sensitivity and specificity of our novel real-time EGFRvIII detection assay to conventional RT-PCR and direct sequencing. Our assay can specifically detect EGFRvIII and can discriminate against wild-type EGFR in FFPE tumor samples. AQUAnalysis{\textregistered} revealed that the presence of EGFRvIII transcript is associated with very high EGFR protein expression (98(th) percentile). Contrary to previous reports, only 44{\%} of OSCC over-expressed EGFR in our study.

CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that the EGFRvIII mutation is rare in OSCC and corroborate previous reports of EGFRvIII expression only in tumors with extreme over-expression of EGFR. We conclude that EGFRvIII-specific therapies may not be ideally suited as first-line treatment in OSCC. Furthermore, highly specific and sensitive methods, such as the real-time RT-PCR assay and AQUAnalysis{\textregistered} described here, will provide accurate assessment of EGFR mutation frequency and EGFR expression, and will facilitate the selection of optimal tailored therapies for OSCC patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the relative sensitivities of glucose transporter isoforms to the protease inhibitor indinavir and to determine the kinetic mechanism of indinavir-mediated Glut4 isoform inhibition. METHODS: The rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was measured in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing mammalian Glut isoforms. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake was also measured in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and primary rat adipocytes. RESULTS: The sensitivity to inhibition by indinavir among the Glut isoforms as assayed in the X. laevis oocyte system was as follows in decreasing order: Glut4 {\textgreater}{\textgreater} Glut2 {\textgreater} Glut3 {\textgreater} Glut1 approximately Glut8. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake measurements in insulin-stimulated primary rat adipocytes indicated a non-competitive mode of transport inhibition by indinavir under zero-trans conditions with a KI of 15 microM. CONCLUSIONS: Indinavir appears to be a relatively selective inhibitor of the Glut4 isoform. As the concentration required to significantly inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in primary rat adipocytes is well within the physiologic range achieved in therapy, we conclude that direct inhibition of Glut4 contributes to the insulin resistance observed in patients receiving this drug.},

@article{Shao2010,
abstract = {The ubiquitously expressed family of alpha-actinins bridges actin filaments to stabilize adhesions, a process disrupted during growth factor-induced migration of cells. During the dissolution of the actin cytoskeleton, actinins are phosphorylated on tyrosines, although the consequences of this are unknown. We expressed the two isoforms of human alpha-actinin in murine fibroblasts that express human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and found that both alpha-actinin 1 (ACTN1) and alpha-actinin 4 (ACTN4) were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues after stimulation with EGF, although ACTN4 was phosphorylated to the greater extent. This required the activation of Src protein-tyrosine kinase and p38-MAPK (and phosphoinositide trisphosphate kinase in part) but not MEK/ERK or Rac1, as determined by inhibitors. The EGF-induced phosphorylation sites of ACTN4 were mapped to tyrosine 4, the major site, and tyrosine 31, the minor one. Truncation mutagenesis showed that the C-terminal domains of ACTN4 (amino acids 300-911), which cross-link the actin binding head domains, act as an inhibitory domain for both actin binding and EGF-mediated phosphorylation. These two properties were mutually exclusive; removal of the C terminus enhanced actin binding of ACTN4 mutants while limiting EGF-induced phosphorylation, and conversely EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of ACTN4 decreased its affinity to actin. Interestingly, a phosphomimetic of tyrosine 265 (which can be found in carcinoma cells and lies near the K255E mutation that causes focal segmental glomerulosclerosis) demonstrated increased actin binding activity and susceptibility of ACTN4 to calpain-mediated cleavage; this variant also retarded cell spreading. Remarkably, either treatment of cells with low concentrations of latrunculin A, which has been shown to depolymerize F-actin, or the deletion of the actin binding domain (100-252 amino acids) of ACTN4Y265E restored EGF-induced phosphorylation. An F-actin binding assay in vitro showed that Y4E/Y31E, a mimetic of diphosphorylated ACTN4, bound F-actin slightly compared with wild type (WT). Importantly, the EGF-mediated phosphorylation of ACTN4 at tyrosine 4 and 31 significantly inhibited multinucleation of proliferating NR6WT fibroblasts that overexpress ACTN4. These results suggest that EGF regulates the actin binding activity of ACTN4 by inducing tyrosyl-directed phosphorylation.},

abstract = {A bis-mannose-photolabel-displacement method has been developed for resolving the separate kinetic properties of the glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, which are both present in 3T3-L1 cells. We have quantified the cell-surface transporter abundance (Bmax.) for the two isoforms by displacing radiolabelled 2-N-[4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl]-1,3-bis-(D- mannos-4-yloxy)-2-propylamine (ATB-BMPA) by non-labelled ATB-BMPA. In cells acutely treated with insulin, the GLUT1 Bmax. was 0.19 microM and the GLUT4 Bmax. was 0.17 microM. In cells which were chronically treated with insulin, the GLUT1 Bmax. was increased by approximately 4-fold to 0.7 microM, whereas the GLUT4 was decreased by approximately 50{\%} (Bmax. = 0.1 microM). However, this large increase in total concentrations of cell-surface transporters (the sum of GLUT1 and GLUT4 concentrations) was not reflected in a large increase in 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport, suggesting that GLUT1 makes a smaller contribution to transport than does GLUT4. In acutely insulin-treated cells at 37 degrees C, the apparent kinetic parameters for 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport were Vapp.max. = 0.52 mM.s-1 and Kapp.m = 12.3 mM. In chronically insulin-treated cells the Vapp.max. = 1.24 mM.s-1 and Kapp.m = 23.0 mM. We have measured the displacement of ATB-BMPA by different concentrations of 3-O-methyl-D-glucose to resolve the separate affinity constants of GLUT1 and GLUT4 for this transported ligand. In acute- and chronic-insulin-treated cells the GLUT1 Km for 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was approximately 20 mM, and the GLUT4 Km for 3-O-methyl-D-glucose was approximately 7 mM. An analysis of these data and the 3-O-methyl-D-glucose transport rates was carried out to calculate transport capacity (TK values) for the two isoforms at 37 degrees C. In acute- and chronic-insulin-treated cells the TK values were 0.36 x 10(4) mM-1.min-1 for GLUT1 and 1.13 x 10(4) mM-1.min-1 for GLUT4. Thus GLUT1 has an approximately 3-fold lower transport capacity than GLUT4 at low concentrations of transported sugar. The lower GLUT1 transport capacity was shown to be mainly due to the high Km of GLUT1. The calculated turnover numbers were 7.2 x 10(4) min-1 for GLUT1 and 7.9 x 10(4) min-1 for GLUT4.},

abstract = {Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) play a critical role in cardiac myocyte signaling in both healthy and diseased cells. Mitochondria represent the predominant cellular source of ROS, specifically the activity of complexes I and III. The model presented here explores the modulation of electron transport chain ROS production for state 3 and state 4 respiration and the role of substrates and respiratory inhibitors. Model simulations show that ROS production from complex III increases exponentially with membrane potential ($\Delta$$\Psi$m) when in state 4. Complex I ROS release in the model can occur in the presence of NADH and succinate (reverse electron flow), leading to a highly reduced ubiquinone pool, displaying the highest ROS production flux in state 4. In the presence of ample ROS scavenging, total ROS production is moderate in state 3 and increases substantially under state 4 conditions. The ROS production model was extended by combining it with a minimal model of ROS scavenging. When the mitochondrial redox status was oxidized by increasing the proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane, simulations with the combined model show that ROS levels initially decline as production drops off with decreasing $\Delta$$\Psi$m and then increase as scavenging capacity is exhausted. Hence, this mechanistic model of ROS production demonstrates how ROS levels are controlled by mitochondrial redox balance.},

abstract = {Tumor suppressor p53 protects cells from genomic insults and is a target of mutation in more than 50{\%} of human cancers. Stress-mediated modification and increased stability of p53 promote p53 interaction with chromatin, which results in transcription of target genes that are critical for the maintenance of genomic integrity. We recently discovered that TRIM24, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, ubiquitinates and promotes proteasome-mediated degradation of p53. Here, we show that TRIM24 is destabilized by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of TRIM24S768 in response to DNA damage, which disrupts TRIM24-p53 interactions and promotes the degradation of TRIM24. Transcription of TRIM24 is directly induced by damage-activated p53, which binds p53 response elements and activates expression of TRIM24. Newly synthesized TRIM24 interacts with phosphorylated p53 to target it for degradation and termination of the DNA damage response. These studies indicate that TRIM24, like MDM2, controls p53 levels in an autoregulatory feedback loop. However, unlike MDM2, TRIM24 also targets activated p53 to terminate p53-regulated response to DNA damage.},

abstract = {An environment of high glucose concentration stimulates the synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) in mesangial cell (MC) cultures. This may result from a similar increase in intracellular glucose concentration. We theorized that increased uptake, rather than glucose concentration per se is the major determinant of exaggerated ECM formation. To test this, we compared the effects of 35 mM glucose on ECM synthesis in normal MCs with those of 8 mM glucose in the same cells overexpressing the glucose transporter GLUT1 (MCGT1). Increasing medium glucose from 8 to 35 mM caused normal MCs to increase total collagen synthesis and catabolism, with a net 81-90{\%} increase in accumulation. MCs transduced with the human GLUT1 gene (MCGT1) grown in 8 mM glucose had a 10-fold greater GLUT1 protein expression and a 1.9, 2.1, and 2.5-fold increase in cell myo-inositol, lactate production, and cell sorbitol content, respectively, as compared to control MCs transduced with bacterial beta-galactosidase (MCLacZ). MCGT1 also demonstrated increased glucose uptake (5-fold) and increased net utilization (43-fold), and greater synthesis of individual ECM components than MCLacZ. In addition, total collagen synthesis and catabolism were also enhanced with a net collagen accumulation 111-118{\%} greater than controls. Thus, glucose transport activity is an important modulator of ECM formation by MCs; the presence of high extracellular glucose concentrations is not necessarily required for the stimulation of matrix synthesis.},

One frequent alteration found in this type of cancer is overactivation of the PI3K/PTEN/mTOR pathway, of which protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt is a central key element, controlling important cellular processes such as metabolism, cell size, proliferation and apoptosis, ultimately regulating cell growth and survival. Thus, drugs that target Akt directly or elements of the pathway are plausible candidates for cancer treatment. Accordingly, numerous clinical trials in various phases are being performed for these drugs. In this review, we discuss the tumorigenic capacity of Akt and focus on its role in HNSCC, paying special attention to the current efforts in treating this cancer in a more specific, Akt-targeted way, based on its primordial role in this type of cancer.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the 10 most common cancers with a 50{\%} five-year survival rate, which has remained unchanged for the past three decades. One of the major reasons for the aggressiveness of this cancer is that HNSCCs readily metastasize to cervical lymph nodes that are abundant in the head and neck region. Hence, discovering new molecules controlling the metastatic process as well as understanding their regulation at the molecular level are essential for effective therapeutic strategies.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Rab25 expression level was analyzed in HNSCC tissue microarray. We used a combination of intravital microscopy in live animals and immunofluorescence in an in vitro invasion assay to study the role of Rab25 in tumor cell migration and invasion.

RESULTS: In this study, we identified the small GTPase Rab25 as a key regulator of HNSCC metastasis. We observed that Rab25 is downregulated in HNSCC patients. Next, we determined that reexpression of Rab25 in a metastatic cell line is sufficient to block invasion in a three-dimensional collagen matrix and metastasis to cervical lymph nodes in a mouse model for oral cancer. Specifically, Rab25 affects the organization of F-actin at the cell surface, rather than cell proliferation, apoptosis, or tumor angiogenesis.

CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that Rab25 plays an important role in tumor migration and metastasis, and that understanding its function may lead to the development of new strategies to prevent metastasis in oral cancer patients.},

abstract = {The clinical use of several first generation HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) is associated with the development of insulin resistance. Indinavir has been shown to act as a potent reversible noncompetitive inhibitor of zero-trans glucose influx via direct interaction with the insulin responsive facilitative glucose transporter GLUT4. Newer drugs within this class have differing effects on insulin sensitivity in treated patients. GLUTs are known to contain two distinct glucose-binding sites that are located on opposite sides of the lipid bilayer. To determine whether interference with the cytoplasmic glucose binding site is responsible for differential effects of PIs on glucose transport, intact intracellular membrane vesicles containing GLUT1 and GLUT4, which have an inverted transporter orientation relative to the plasma membrane, were isolated from 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The binding of biotinylated ATB-BMPA, a membrane impermeable bis-mannose containing photolabel, was determined in the presence of indinavir, ritonavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and cytochalasin b. Zero-trans 2-deoxyglucose transport was measured in both 3T3-L1 fibroblasts and primary rat adipocytes acutely exposed to these compounds. PI inhibition of glucose transport correlated strongly with the PI inhibition of ATB-BMPA/transporter binding. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, ritonavir was not selective for GLUT4 over GLUT1. Indinavir was found to act as a competitive inhibitor of the cytoplasmic glucose binding site of GLUT4 with a K(I) of 8.2 µM. These data establish biotinylated ATB-BMPA as an effective probe to quantify accessibility of the endofacial glucose-binding site in GLUTs and reveal that the ability of PIs to block this site differs among drugs within this class. This provides mechanistic insight into the basis for the clinical variation in drug-related metabolic toxicity.},

abstract = {The predominant mechanism by which insulin activates glucose transport in muscle and adipose tissue is by affecting the redistribution of the facilitated hexose carriers, GLUT1 and GLUT4, from an intracellular site to the plasma membrane. A quantitative analysis of this process has been hampered by the lack of reliable determinations for kinetic constants catalyzed by each of these isoforms. In order to obtain such information, each transporter was expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the injection of mRNA encoding rat GLUT1 or GLUT4. Equilibrium exchange 3-O-methylglucose uptake was measured and the data fitted to a two-compartment model, yielding Km = 26.2 mM and Vmax = 3.5 nmol/min/cell for GLUT1 and Km = 4.3 mM and Vmax = 0.7 nmol/min/cell for GLUT4. Measurement of the abundance of cell surface transporters was accomplished by two independent protocols: photolabeling with the impermeant hexose analog 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2-propylamine and subcellular fractionation of oocytes. Data obtained by either technique revealed that the ratio of plasma membrane GLUT1 to GLUT4 was about 4; this paralleled the relative maximal velocities for hexose transport, indicating that the turn-over numbers for the two isoforms were the same. Moreover, measurement of the concentration of exofacially disposed transporters with 2-N-4-(1-azi-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)benzoyl-1,3-bis(D-mannos-4 -yloxy)-2-propylamine allowed calculation of the turnover number to be about 20,000 min-1. These data indicate that, at low substrate concentrations, the catalytic efficiency of GLUT4 is significantly greater than GLUT1. Extrapolation to mammalian systems suggests that GLUT4 is responsible for virtually all of the hexose uptake in insulin-responsive targets, particularly in the presence of hormone.},

abstract = {mTORC1 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1) controls transcriptional programs that determine CD8+ cytolytic T cell (CTL) fate. In some cell systems, mTORC1 couples phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) and Akt to the control of glucose uptake and glycolysis. However, PI3K-Akt-independent mechanisms control glucose metabolism in CD8+ T cells, and the role of mTORC1 has not been explored. The present study now demonstrates that mTORC1 activity in CD8+ T cells is not dependent on PI3K or Akt but is critical to sustain glucose uptake and glycolysis in CD8+ T cells. We also show that PI3K- and Akt-independent pathways mediated by mTORC1 regulate the expression of HIF1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) transcription factor complex. This mTORC1-HIF1 pathway is required to sustain glucose metabolism and glycolysis in effector CTLs and strikingly functions to couple mTORC1 to a diverse transcriptional program that controls expression of glucose transporters, multiple rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, cytolytic effector molecules, and essential chemokine and adhesion receptors that regulate T cell trafficking. These data reveal a fundamental mechanism linking nutrient and oxygen sensing to transcriptional control of CD8+ T cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Hemolysis or extensive cell damage can lead to high concentrations of free heme, causing oxidative stress and inflammation. Considering that heme induces neutrophil chemotaxis, we hypothesize that heme activates a G protein-coupled receptor. Here we show that similar to heme, several heme analogs were able to induce neutrophil migration in vitro and in vivo. Mesoporphyrins, molecules lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited heme-induced migration. Moreover, migration of neutrophils induced by heme was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Galpha inhibitory protein, and with inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, phospholipase Cbeta, mitogen-activated protein kinases, or Rho kinase. The induction of reactive oxygen species by heme was dependent of Galpha inhibitory protein and phosphoinositide 3-kinase and partially dependent of phospholipase Cbeta, protein kinase C, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and Rho kinase. Together, our results indicate that heme activates neutrophils through signaling pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules and suggest that mesoporphyrins might prove valuable in the treatment of the inflammatory consequences of hemorrhagic and hemolytic disorders. .. The immune/inflammatory responses triggered by molecules of infectious agents or host origin are amplified by cytokines, lipid mediators, and reactive oxygen species (1). Diseases of increased intra- and extravascular hemolysis or extensive cell damage can lead to high levels of free heme (2-4). As the prosthetic moiety of inactive apo-heme proteins, heme provides a wide range of biological functions determined in part by the polypeptide associated to it (5). Once released from heme proteins, free heme can amplify the cell damage and the inflammatory response (6). A hallmark of inflammation is the recruitment of leukocytes out of the vasculature to tissues. This process depends on the interplay of selected molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells occurring in several stages, the so-called three steps paradigm of cell migration (7). Heme seems to affect this process in several ways: (a) inducing cell adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells; (b) increasing vascular permeability; (c) enhancing chemokine expression and secretion; (d) inducing migration of leukocytes, especially neutrophils (6, 8). It has been assumed and widely accepted that the mechanism by which heme exerts its damaging effects relies on its amphipathic nature, allowing heme to intercalate the cell or organelle membranes, and on its pro-oxidant effects (6, 9, 10). The induction of neutrophil migration by heme is dependent on protein kinase C activation (8), and heme is able to delay neutrophil apoptosis in vitro dependently of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K),4 extracellular-signaling kinase (ERK), and NF-$\kappa$B pathways (11). The ability of heme to induce neutrophil migration in vitro indicates that heme is a chemoattractant. To date, the nature of neutrophil chemoattractants includes a variety of peptides (for example, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, C3a and C5a, and CXC chemokines) and lipids (for example, PAF and LTB4), which are, without exception, ligands of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to a G$\alpha$ inhibitory (G$\alpha$i) protein sensitive to pertussis toxin (PTX) (12). Binding and activation of these receptors activate G$\alpha$i protein, PI3K, and MAPKs, stimulating neutrophil migration (13, 14). Thus, we hypothesize that heme acts on neutrophil migration by activating a G$\alpha$i-coupled receptor. In this study, we show the structural requirements by which porphyrins affect neutrophil migration in vitro and promote inflammation in vivo. Several heme analogs were able to induce neutrophil migration, whereas mesoporphyrins, molecules lacking the vinyl groups in their rings, were not chemotactic for neutrophils and selectively inhibited the migration induced by heme. The neutrophil migration and ROS production induced by heme were inhibited by pertussis toxin, thus indicating the involvement of a G$\alpha$i protein. The use of selective inhibitors indicates that heme activates neutrophils through signaling pathways that are characteristic of chemoattractant molecules. Together, these results suggest that heme activates neutrophils through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR).},

abstract = {Since radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and ROS generation were partially prevented by HSP25 overexpression, similar to the treatment of control cells with antioxidant agents such as DPI and tiron, questions arise whether radiation-mediated ROS generation contributes to the apoptotic cell death, and also whether HSP25 overexpression can reduce ROS mediated apoptotic cell death. In the present study, radiation-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria and activation of caspases accompanied by a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential in Jurkat T cells were shown to be inhibited by mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone, suggesting that mitochondrial ROS might be important in radiation-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis. When HSP25 was overexpressed, effects similar to the treatment of cells with the antioxidants were obtained, indicating that HSP25 suppressed radiation-induced mitochondrial alteration that resulted in apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of p38 MAP kinase by radiation was associated with radiation-induced cell death and ROS production and PKCdelta was an upstream molecule for p38 MAP kinase activation, ROS generation and subsequent caspase-dependent apoptotic events. However, in the HSP25 overexpressed cells, the above-described effects were blocked. In fact, radiation-induced membrane translocation of PKCdelta and tyrosine phosphorylation were inhibited by HSP25. Based on the above data, we suggest that HSP25 downregulates PKCdelta, which is a key molecule for radiation-induced ROS generation and mitochondrial-mediated caspase-dependent apoptotic events.},

Consideration of the fluid dynamics of cancer cell movement along capillaries lead to the view that in vivo, arrest is primarily due to mechanical trapping of cancer cells, and that the pathobiologic role of so-called adhesion molecules is not mainly in the arrest and adhesion of cancer cells, but rather in stimulating their proliferation by signal induction. As a consequence of deformation from spherical-to-cylindrical shape in the microvasculature, demands for increased surface membrane area leads to increases in surface membrane tension above critical levels for rupture, and the cancer cells are rapidly and lethally damaged. The possibility is briefly discussed of increasing the susceptibility of circulating cancer cells to mechanical trauma, as a form of anti-metastatic therapy.},

abstract = {Overexpression of EGFR plays a key-role in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and justifies the extensive use of cetuximab, a monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody, as well as EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), which have been reported to inhibit tumor cell growth and the secretion of pro-angiogenic factors by tumor cells, such as VEGF and IL-8. Moreover, vessel normalization in tumors, suggesting a more complex mediation of endothelial cell growth control has also been observed in vivo. The present study was designed to investigate the angiogenic consequences of exposure of HNSCC tumor cell lines to cetuximab and intercellular signaling between tumor and endothelial cells by secretion of pro- and anti-angiogenic mediators in the conditioned media (CM). The results achieved showed that cetuximab decreased the secretion of VEGF by HNSCC cells and that exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to CM from HNSCC cells exposed to cetuximab induced an increase in endothelial cell network formation. Angiogenesis proteome profiling showed that cetuximab induced a complex alteration of the secretion of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors by HNSCC cells without enabling to identify a unique molecular marker. Expression of endothelial membrane receptors (VEGFR-2, EGFR, PECAM-1 and Notch-4) was investigated and only EGFR expression was found influenced when HUVEC were exposed to CM from cetuximab-exposed HNSCC cells. These results showed that the decrease in the secretion of pro-angiogenic agents like VEGF by HNSCC cells exposed to cetuximab could not be sufficient to justify its anti-angiogenic activity in vitro.},

abstract = {Prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is largely determined by the extent of lymph node (LN) metastasis at diagnosis, and this appears to be controlled by cancer cell genetics. To examine the role of these genes in LN metastasis, we created a human-in-mouse orthotopic model of HNSCC and performed comparative microarray analysis of gene expression between populations of HNSCC cell lines derived before and after serial transplantation and in vivo metastasis in mice. Microarray analysis comparing the USC-HN3-GFP, USC-HN3-GFP-G1 and USC-HN3-GFP-G2 cell lines identified overexpression of genes implicated in epithelial-to- mesenchymal transition and the formation of cancer stem cells, including CAV-1, TLR-4 (Toll-like receptor 4), MMP-7 (matrix metalloproteinase 7), ALDH1A3, OCT-4 and TRIM-29. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis confirmed upregulation of respective gene signaling pathways in the USC-HN1-GFP-G2 cell line. Patient HNSCC samples from advanced stages overexpressed ALDH1A3, CAV-1 and MMP-7. Our results show that CAV-1, TLR-4, MMP-7, ALDH1A3, OCT-4 and TRIM-29 have increased expression in HNSCC cells selected for an enhanced metastatic phenotype and suggest that these genes may have an important role in the metastatic potential of HNSCC cells. Inhibition of these genes may therefore have prognostic and therapeutic utility in HNSCC.},

abstract = {Platinum-based chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer, but recurrence occurs in most patients. Recent evidence suggests that CD133(+) cells are the cause of drug resistance and tumor recurrence. However, the correlation between chemotherapy and regulation of CD133(+) cells has not been investigated methodically. In this study, we revealed that CD133(+) lung cancer cells labeled by a human CD133 promoter-driven GFP reporter exhibited drug resistance and stem cell characteristics. Treatment of H460 and H661 cell lines with low-dose cisplatin (IC(20)) was sufficient to enrich CD133(+) cells, to induce DNA damage responses, and to upregulate ABCG2 and ABCB1 expression, which therefore increased the cross-resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. This cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133(+) cells was mediated through Notch signaling as judged by increased levels of cleaved Notch1 (NICD1). Pretreatment with the $\gamma$-secretase inhibitor, N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), or Notch1 short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) remarkably reduced the cisplatin-induced enrichment of CD133(+) cells and increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Ectopic expression of NICD1 reversed the action of DAPT on drug sensitivity. Immunohistochemistry showed that CD133(+) cells were significantly increased in the relapsed tumors in three of six patients with lung cancer who have received cisplatin treatment. A similar effect was observed in animal experiments as cisplatin treatment increased Notch1 cleavage and the ratio of CD133(+) cells in engrafted tumors. Intratumoral injection of DAPT with cisplatin treatment significantly reduced CD133(+) cell number. Together, our results showed that cisplatin induces the enrichment of CD133(+) cells, leading to multidrug resistance by the activation of Notch signaling.},

abstract = {G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the largest and most diverse family of membrane receptors in the human genome, relaying information from a vast array of external stimuli. GPCRs are targets for approximately 30{\%} of all current therapeutic agents. Recently some GPCRs have been shown to mediate part of their effects through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a sensor of whole body energy status that plays a pivotal role in whole body energy balance by integrating signals in the periphery and central nervous system. It regulates glucose and lipid metabolism, food intake and body weight, making it an attractive target for the treatment of diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. It mediates the effects of several important adipokines such as leptin and adiponectin and is thought to be responsible for the antidiabetic effects of metformin and thiazolidinediones. A diverse number of GPCRs (including adrenoceptors, cannabinoid receptors, ghrelin receptors, melanocortin receptors) modulate AMPK activity. This review focuses on the regulation of AMPK by GPCRs and signaling intermediates of GPCR signaling such as cyclic AMP and calcium, and how GPCR signaling can modulate AMPK activity by several different mechanisms, and the therapeutic implications of AMPK activation by GPCRs.},

Therefore, interrupting the RAS-MAPK pathway by an ERK1/2 inhibitor (apigenin) or an AURKB inhibitor (barasertib) might be a new strategy for overcoming cetuximab resistance in HNSCC.},

abstract = {The type I interferon response protects cells against invading viral pathogens. The cellular factors that mediate this defence are the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Although hundreds of ISGs have been identified since their discovery more than 25 years ago, only a few have been characterized with respect to antiviral activity. For most ISG products, little is known about their antiviral potential, their target specificity and their mechanisms of action. Using an overexpression screening approach, here we show that different viruses are targeted by unique sets of ISGs. We find that each viral species is susceptible to multiple antiviral genes, which together encompass a range of inhibitory activities. To conduct the screen, more than 380 human ISGs were tested for their ability to inhibit the replication of several important human and animal viruses, including hepatitis C virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, chikungunya virus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus and human immunodeficiency virus type-1. Broadly acting effectors included IRF1, C6orf150 (also known as MB21D1), HPSE, RIG-I (also known as DDX58), MDA5 (also known as IFIH1) and IFITM3, whereas more targeted antiviral specificity was observed with DDX60, IFI44L, IFI6, IFITM2, MAP3K14, MOV10, NAMPT (also known as PBEF1), OASL, RTP4, TREX1 and UNC84B (also known as SUN2). Combined expression of pairs of ISGs showed additive antiviral effects similar to those of moderate type I interferon doses. Mechanistic studies uncovered a common theme of translational inhibition for numerous effectors. Several ISGs, including ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E and MCOLN2, enhanced the replication of certain viruses, highlighting another layer of complexity in the highly pleiotropic type I interferon system.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: c-Src inhibition in cancer cells leads to an abrogation of invasion but a variable effect on apoptosis. The pathways downstream of c-Src promoting survival are not well characterized. Because cancer therapy that both decreases invasion and induces significant apoptosis would be ideal, we sought to characterize the mechanisms of resistance to c-Src inhibition.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: c-Src was inhibited in a panel of oral cancer cell lines and subsequent survival and signaling measured. The interactions between c-Src and c-Met were evaluated using immunoprecitation and an in vitro kinase assay. Cytotoxicity was measured and the Chou-Talalay combination index calculated. An orthotopic model of oral cancer was used to assess the effects of c-Met and c-Src inhibitors.

RESULTS: Inhibition of c-Src resulted in c-Met inhibition in sensitive cells lines, but not in resistant cell lines. Isolated c-Met was a c-Src substrate in both sensitive and resistant cells, but there was no interaction of c-Src and c-Met in intact resistant cells. To examine the biological consequences of this mechanism, we demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity, enhanced apoptosis, and decreased tumor size with the combination of c-Src and c-Met inhibitors.

CONCLUSIONS: Sustained c-Met activation can mediate resistance to c-Src inhibition. These data suggest that the differences between c-Met and c-Src signaling in sensitive and resistant cells are due to distinct factors promoting or inhibiting interactions, respectively, rather than to intrinsic structural changes in c-Src or c-Met. The synergistic cytotoxic effects of c-Src and c-Met inhibition may be important for the treatment of head and neck cancers.},

With VDAC3 to the greatest extent, all VDAC isoforms contributed to the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, but only VDAC3 knockdown decreased ATP, ADP, NAD(P)H, and mitochondrial redox state. Cells expressing predominantly VDAC3 were least sensitive to depolarization induced by increased free tubulin. In planar lipid bilayers, free tubulin inhibited VDAC1 and VDAC2 but not VDAC3. Erastin, a compound that interacts with VDAC, blocked and reversed mitochondrial depolarization after microtubule destabilizers in intact cells and antagonized tubulin-induced VDAC blockage in planar bilayers. In conclusion, free tubulin inhibits VDAC1/2 and limits mitochondrial metabolism in HepG2 cells, contributing to the Warburg phenomenon. Reversal of tubulin-VDAC interaction by erastin antagonizes Warburg metabolism and restores oxidative mitochondrial metabolism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies have indicated that impaired glucose metabolism may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) regulates glucose and lipid metabolism via the phosphorylation and subsequent inactivation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC).Thus, we analyzed the expression of pAMPK and its downstream target phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (pACC), as well as their impact on the survival of patients with resected SCCHN. METHODS: One hundred eighteen patients with surgically resected SCCHN were enrolled. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for pAMPK and pACC was performed using tissue microarrays of operative specimens of SCCHN. The expression was divided into two or three groups according to the IHC score [pAMPK: negative (0), positive (1-3); pACC: negative (0), low expression (1, 2), and high expression (3)]. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association of pAMPK expression with clinicopathological features and pACC and pErk expression. RESULTS: The positive rates of pAMPK and pACC expression were 64.4{\%} (76/118) and 68.6{\%} (81/118), respectively. pAMPK was significantly higher in patients aged younger than 60 years (P = 0.024; $\chi$2 test) and those with early-stage (T1/T2; P = 0.02; $\chi$2 test) and oral cavity (P = 0.026; Fisher's exact test) tumors. In multivariate analysis, pAMPK expression was not significantly correlated with overall survival (OS) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 0.66; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.35-1.23), whereas high pACC expression was independently associated with worse OS in node-positive patients (adjusted HR: 17.58; 95{\%} CI: 3.50-88.18). CONCLUSIONS: Strong expression of pACC was found to be an independent prognostic marker for patients with node-positive SCCHN. Our results suggest that pACC may play a role in tumor progression of SCCHN and may help to identify patient subgroups at high risk for poor disease outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently, the availability of high-resolution microscopy together with the advancements in the development of biomarkers as reporters of biomolecular interactions increased the importance of imaging methods in molecular cell biology. These techniques enable the investigation of cellular characteristics like volume, size and geometry as well as volume and geometry of intracellular compartments, and the amount of existing proteins in a spatially resolved manner. Such detailed investigations opened up many new areas of research in the study of spatial, complex and dynamic cellular systems. One of the crucial challenges for the study of such systems is the design of a well stuctured and optimized workflow to provide a systematic and efficient hypothesis verification. Computer Science can efficiently address this task by providing software that facilitates handling, analysis, and evaluation of biological data to the benefit of experimenters and modelers.

RESULTS: The Spatio-Temporal Simulation Environment (STSE) is a set of open-source tools provided to conduct spatio-temporal simulations in discrete structures based on microscopy images. The framework contains modules to digitize, represent, analyze, and mathematically model spatial distributions of biochemical species. Graphical user interface (GUI) tools provided with the software enable meshing of the simulation space based on the Voronoi concept. In addition, it supports to automatically acquire spatial information to the mesh from the images based on pixel luminosity (e.g. corresponding to molecular levels from microscopy images). STSE is freely available either as a stand-alone version or included in the linux live distribution Systems Biology Operational Software (SB.OS) and can be downloaded from http://www.stse-software.org/. The Python source code as well as a comprehensive user manual and video tutorials are also offered to the research community. We discuss main concepts of the STSE design and workflow. We demonstrate it's usefulness using the example of a signaling cascade leading to formation of a morphological gradient of Fus3 within the cytoplasm of the mating yeast cell Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

CONCLUSIONS: STSE is an efficient and powerful novel platform, designed for computational handling and evaluation of microscopic images. It allows for an uninterrupted workflow including digitization, representation, analysis, and mathematical modeling. By providing the means to relate the simulation to the image data it allows for systematic, image driven model validation or rejection. STSE can be scripted and extended using the Python language. STSE should be considered rather as an API together with workflow guidelines and a collection of GUI tools than a stand alone application. The priority of the project is to provide an easy and intuitive way of extending and customizing software using the Python language.},

abstract = {Dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), the first stable oxidation product of vitamin C, was transported by GLUT1 and GLUT3 in Xenopus laevis oocytes with transport rates similar to that of 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), but due to inherent difficulties with GLUT4 expression in oocytes it was uncertain whether GLUT4 transported DHA (Rumsey, S. C. , Kwon, O., Xu, G. W., Burant, C. F., Simpson, I., and Levine, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 18982-18989). We therefore studied DHA and 2-DG transport in rat adipocytes, which express GLUT4. Without insulin, rat adipocytes transported 2-DG 2-3-fold faster than DHA. Preincubation with insulin (0.67 micrometer) increased transport of each substrate similarly: 7-10-fold for 2-DG and 6-8-fold for DHA. Because intracellular reduction of DHA in adipocytes was complete before and after insulin stimulation, increased transport of DHA was not explained by increased internal reduction of DHA to ascorbate. To determine apparent transport kinetics of GLUT4 for DHA, GLUT4 expression in Xenopus oocytes was reexamined. Preincubation of oocytes for {\textgreater}4 h with insulin (1 micrometer) augmented GLUT4 transport of 2-DG and DHA by up to 5-fold. Transport of both substrates was inhibited by cytochalasin B and displayed saturable kinetics. GLUT4 had a higher apparent transport affinity (K(m) of 0.98 versus 5.2 mm) and lower maximal transport rate (V(max) of 66 versus 880 pmol/oocyte/10 min) for DHA compared with 2-DG. The lower transport rate for DHA could not be explained by binding differences at the outer membrane face, as shown by inhibition with ethylidene glucose, or by transporter trans-activation and therefore was probably due to substrate-specific differences in transporter/substrate translocation or release. These novel data indicate that the insulin-sensitive transporter GLUT4 transports DHA in both rat adipocytes and Xenopus oocytes. Alterations of this mechanism in diabetes could have clinical implications for ascorbate utilization.},

abstract = {The glucose transporter GLUT8 cycles between intracellular vesicles and the plasma membrane. Like the insulin-responsive glucose transporter GLUT4, GLUT8 is primarily located in intracellular compartments under basal conditions. Whereas translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane is stimulated by insulin, the distribution of GLUT8 is not affected by insulin treatment in adipose cells. However, blocking endocytosis by co-expression of a dominant-negative dynamin GTPase (K44A) or mutation of the N-terminal dileucine (LL(12/13)) motif in GLUT8 leads to accumulation of the glucose transporter at the cell surface in a variety of different cell types. Yeast two-hybrid analyses and GST pulldown assays reveal that the LL signal constitutes a binding site for the beta2-adaptin subunit of the heterotetrameric AP-2 adaptor complex, implicating this motif in targeting of GLUT8 to clathrin-coated vesicles. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid assays provide evidence that the binding site for the LL motif maps to the appendage domain of beta2-adaptin. To analyze the biological significance of the LL/beta2 interaction, we utilized RNA interference to specifically knockdown AP-2. Our results show that RNAi-mediated targeting of the mu2 subunit leads to cellular depletion of AP-2, but not AP-1 adaptor complexes in HeLa cells. As a consequence, GLUT8 accumulates at the plasma membrane at comparable levels to those observed in K44A-transfected cells. Conversely, the intracellular localization of mutant GLUT8-LL/AA is restored by replacing the LL motif in GLUT8 with the transferrin receptor-derived mu2-adaptin binding motif YTRF, indicating that for endocytosis both AP-2 binding motifs can substitute for each other. Thus, our data demonstrate that recruitment of GLUT8 to the endocytic machinery occurs via direct interaction of the dileucine motif with beta2-adaptin, and that endocytosis might be the main site at which GLUT8 is likely to be regulated.},

abstract = {The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) network consists of tightly interconnected signalling pathways involved in diverse cellular processes, such as cell cycle, survival, apoptosis and differentiation. Although several studies reported the involvement of these signalling cascades in cancer deregulations, the precise mechanisms underlying their influence on the balance between cell proliferation and cell death (cell fate decision) in pathological circumstances remain elusive. Based on an extensive analysis of published data, we have built a comprehensive and generic reaction map for the MAPK signalling network, using CellDesigner software. In order to explore the MAPK responses to different stimuli and better understand their contributions to cell fate decision, we have considered the most crucial components and interactions and encoded them into a logical model, using the software GINsim. Our logical model analysis particularly focuses on urinary bladder cancer, where MAPK network deregulations have often been associated with specific phenotypes. To cope with the combinatorial explosion of the number of states, we have applied novel algorithms for model reduction and for the compression of state transition graphs, both implemented into the software GINsim. The results of systematic simulations for different signal combinations and network perturbations were found globally coherent with published data. In silico experiments further enabled us to delineate the roles of specific components, cross-talks and regulatory feedbacks in cell fate decision. Finally, tentative proliferative or anti-proliferative mechanisms can be connected with established bladder cancer deregulations, namely Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) over-expression and Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) activating mutations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cell adhesion has been shown to induce activation of certain growth factor receptors in a ligand-independent manner. However, the mechanism for such activation remains obscure.

METHODS: Human epidermal carcinoma A431 cells were used as a model to examine the mechanism for adhesion-induced activation of hepatocyte growth factor receptor Met and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The cells were suspended and replated on culture dishes under various conditions. The phosphorylation of Met at Y1234/1235 and EGFR at Y1173 were used as indicators for their activation. The distribution of the receptors and lipid rafts on the plasma membrane were visualized by confocal fluorescent microscopy and total internal reflection microscopy.

RESULTS: We demonstrate that Met and EGFR are constitutively activated in A431 cells, which confers proliferative and invasive potentials to the cells. The ligand-independent activation of Met and EGFR in A431 cells relies on cell adhesion to a substratum, but is independent of cell spreading, extracellular matrix proteins, and substratum stiffness. This adhesion-induced activation of Met and EGFR cannot be attributed to Src activation, production of reactive oxygen species, and the integrity of the cytoskeleton. In addition, we demonstrate that Met and EGFR are independently activated upon cell adhesion. However, partial depletion of Met and EGFR prevents their activation upon cell adhesion, suggesting that overexpression of the receptors is a prerequisite for their self-activation upon cell adhesion. Although Met and EGFR are largely distributed in 0.04{\%} Triton-insoluble fractions (i.e. raft fraction), their activated forms are detected mainly in 0.04{\%} Triton-soluble fractions (i.e. non-raft fraction). Upon cell adhesion, lipid rafts are accumulated at the cell surface close to the cell-substratum interface, while Met and EGFR are mostly excluded from the membrane enriched by lipid rafts.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time that cell adhesion to a substratum may induce a polarized distribution of lipid rafts to the cell-substratum interface, which may allow Met and EGFR to be released from lipid rafts, thus leading to their activation in a ligand-independent manner.},

abstract = {Excessive mitochondrial fission is associated with the pathology of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, inhibitors of aberrant mitochondrial fission could provide important research tools in addition to potential leads for drug development. Using a rational approach, we designed a novel and selective peptide inhibitor, P110, of excessive mitochondrial fission. P110 inhibits Drp1 enzyme activity and blocks Drp1/Fis1 interaction in vitro and in cultured neurons, whereas it has no effect on the interaction between Drp1 and other mitochondrial adaptors, as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, using a model of Parkinson's disease (PD) in culture, we demonstrated that P110 is neuroprotective by inhibiting mitochondrial fragmentation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and subsequently improving mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial integrity. P110 increased neuronal cell viability by reducing apoptosis and autophagic cell death, and reduced neurite loss of primary dopaminergic neurons in this PD cell culture model. We also found that P110 treatment appears to have minimal effects on mitochondrial fission and cell viability under basal conditions. Finally, P110 required the presence of Drp1 to inhibit mitochondrial fission under oxidative stress conditions. Taken together, our findings suggest that P110, as a selective peptide inhibitor of Drp1, might be useful for the treatment of diseases in which excessive mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial dysfunction occur.},

abstract = {Insulin regulates glucose uptake through effects on the trafficking of the glucose transporter Glut4. To investigate the degree of overlap between Glut4 and the general endocytic pathways, the kinetics of trafficking of Glut4 and the receptors for transferrin (Tf) and $\alpha$(2)-macroglobulin ($\alpha$-2-M; LRP-1) were compared using quantitative flow cytometric assays. Insulin increased the exocytic rate constant (k(ex)) for both Glut4 and Tf. However, the k(ex) of Glut4 was 5-15 times slower than Tf in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. The endocytic rate constant (k(en)) of Glut4 was also five times slower than Tf. Insulin did not affect the k(en) of either protein. In basal cells, the k(en) for $\alpha$-2-M/LRP-1 was similar to Glut4 but 5-fold slower than Tf. Insulin increased k(en) for $\alpha$-2-M/LRP-1 by 30{\%}. In contrast, the k(ex) for LRP-1 was five times faster than Glut4 in basal cells, and insulin did not increase this rate constant. Thus, although there is overlap in the protein machineries/compartments utilized, the differences in trafficking kinetics indicate that Glut4, the Tf receptor, and LRP-1 are differentially processed both within the cell and at the plasma membrane. It has been reported that insulin decreases the k(en) of Glut4 in adipocytes. However, the effect of exocytosis on the "internalization" assays was not considered. Because it is counterintuitive, the effect of exocytosis on these assays is often overlooked in endocytosis studies. Using mathematical modeling and simulation, we show that the reported decrease in Glut4 k(en) can be entirely accounted for by the well established increase in Glut4 k(ex).},

Experimental Design: Here we use gene expression based consensus clustering, copy number profiling, and HPV-status on a clinically homogenous cohort of 134 locoregionally-advanced HNSCCs with 44{\%} HPV(+) tumors together with additional cohorts, which in total comprise 931 tumors, to identify HNSCC subtypes and discover several subtype-specific, translationally relevant characteristics. Results: We identified five subtypes of HNSCC including two biologically distinct HPV subtypes. One HPV(+) and one HPV(-) subtype show a prominent immune and mesenchymal phenotype. Prominent tumor infiltration with CD8+ lymphocytes characterizes this inflamed/mesenchymal subtypes - independent of HPV status. Compared to other subtypes, the two HPV subtypes show low expression and no copy number events for EGFR/HER-ligands and absence of EGFR/HER-ligand expression. By contrast the Basal subtype is uniquely characterized by a prominent EGFR/HER signaling phenotype driven by multiple HER ligands, as well as strong hypoxic differentiation not seen in other subtypes. Conclusion: Our five-subtype classification provides a comprehensive overview of HPV(+) as well as HPV(-) HNSCC biology with significant translational implications for biomarker development and personalized care for HNSCC patients.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The heart derives energy from a wide variety of substrates including fatty acids, carbohydrates, ketones, and amino acids. The healthy heart generates up to 30{\%} of its ATP from glucose. Under conditions of cardiac injury or stress, the heart relies even more heavily on glucose as a source of fuel. Glucose is transported into the heart by members of the family of facilitative glucose transporters (GLUTs). While research examining the transport of glucose into the heart has primarily focused on the roles of the classical glucose transporters GLUT1 and GLUT4, little is known about the functions of more newly identified GLUT isoforms in the myocardium. METHODS: In this study the presence and relative RNA message abundance of each of the known GLUT isoforms was determined in left ventricular tissue from two commonly used inbred laboratory mouse strains (C57BL/6J and FVB/NJ) by quantitative real time PCR. Relative message abundance was also determined in GLUT4 null mice and in murine models of dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: GLUT4, GLUT1, and GLUT8 were found to be the most abundant GLUT transcripts in the normal heart, while GLUT3, GLUT10, and GLUT12 are present at relatively lower levels. Assessment of relative GLUT expression in left ventricular myocardium from mice with dilated cardiomyopathy revealed increased expression of GLUT1 with reduced levels of GLUT4, GLUT8, and GLUT12. Compensatory increase in the expression of GLUT12 was observed in genetically altered mice lacking GLUT4. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose transporter expression varies significantly among murine models of cardiac dysfunction and involves several of the class III GLUT isoforms. Understanding how these more newly identified GLUT isoforms contribute to regulating myocardial glucose transport will enhance our comprehension of the normal physiology and pathophysiology of the heart.},

Because of their hydrophilic nature, cells use a number of transporter proteins to introduce sugars through their plasma membrane. Cancer cells are well known to display an enhanced sugar uptake and consumption. In fact, sugar transporters are deregulated in cancer cells so they incorporate higher amounts of sugar than normal cells. In this paper, we compile the most significant data available about biochemical and biological properties of sugar transporters in normal tissues and we review the available information about sugar carrier expression in different types of cancer. Moreover, we describe the possible pharmacological interactions between drugs currently used in anticancer therapy and the expression or function of facilitative sugar transporters. Finally, we also go into the insights about the future design of drugs targeted against sugar utilization in cancer cells.},

abstract = {Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the eighth most common malignancy worldwide, comprising a diverse group of cancers affecting the head and neck region. Despite advances in therapeutic options over the last few decades, treatment toxicities and overall clinical outcomes have remained disappointing, thereby underscoring a need to develop novel therapeutic approaches in HNC treatment. Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), a key regulator of heme biosynthesis, was identified from an RNA interference-based high-throughput screen as a tumor-selective radiosensitizing target for HNC. UROD knockdown plus radiation induced caspase-mediated apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in HNC cells in vitro and suppressed the in vivo tumor-forming capacity of HNC cells, as well as delayed the growth of established tumor xenografts in mice. This radiosensitization appeared to be mediated by alterations in iron homeostasis and increased production of reactive oxygen species, resulting in enhanced tumor oxidative stress. Moreover, UROD was significantly overexpressed in HNC patient biopsies. Lower preradiation UROD mRNA expression correlated with improved disease-free survival, suggesting that UROD could potentially be used to predict radiation response. UROD down-regulation also radiosensitized several different models of human cancer, as well as sensitized tumors to chemotherapeutic agents, including 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, and paclitaxel. Thus, our study has revealed UROD as a potent tumor-selective sensitizer for both radiation and chemotherapy, with potential relevance to many human malignancies.},

abstract = {We have established cell lines from six human squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the epidermis and tongue, using culture methods previously developed for clonal growth and serial cultivation of normal keratinocytes. The SCC lines all form rapidly growing, well-differentiated SCC's or progressively growing squamous cysts in nude mice. In contrast to normal keratinocytes, SCC cells form unstratified or very poorly stratifying colonies and do not require epidermal growth factor for sustained growth. The SCC lines vary in their requirement for a fibroblast feeder layer to support clonal growth, as normal keratinocytes possess. Only one line forms large, progressively growing colonies at high efficiency in semisolid medium; the other five lines exhibit only a small amount of abortive growth in semisolid medium, after which the cells appear to rapidly degenerate. These results demonstrate that SCC's often grow as established lines in culture, but they frequently possess in vitro growth requirements similar to those of normal keratinocytes. Consequently, neither semisolid medium nor standard surface culture media are appropriate for initiating primary SCC cultures or for selecting transformants out of carcinogen-treated keratinocyte populations, because they do not provide conditions permissive for the growth of many malignant keratinocytes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: For evidence-based medical practice, well-defined risk scoring systems are essential to identify patients with a poor prognosis. The objective of this study was to develop a prognostic score, the Montreal prognostic score (MPS), to improve prognostication of patients with incurable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in everyday practice.

METHODS: A training cohort (TC) and a confirmatory cohort (CC) of newly diagnosed patients with NSCLC planning to receive chemotherapy were used to develop the MPS. Stage and clinically available biomarkers were entered into a Cox model and risk weights were estimated. C-statistics were used to test the accuracy.

RESULTS: The TC consisted of 258 patients and the CC consisted of 433 patients. Montreal prognostic score classified patients into three distinct groups with median survivals of 2.5 months (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.8, 4.2), 8.2 months (95{\%} CI: 7.0, 9.4) and 18.2 months (95{\%} CI: 14.0, 27.5), respectively (log-rank, P{\textless}0.001). Overall, the C-statistics were 0.691 (95{\%} CI: 0.685, 0.697) for the TC and 0.665 (95{\%} CI: 0.661, 0.670) for the CC.

CONCLUSION: The MPS, by classifying patients into three well-defined prognostic groups, provides valuable information, which physicians could use to better inform their patients about treatment options, especially the best timing to involve palliative care teams.},

Recently, we created a new mouse and stem cell model by knock-in addition of an epitope tag at Trp53. Biochemical purification of endogenous, tagged p53-protein complexes from mouse embryonic stem cells, and peptide analysis by mass spectrometry, revealed a new RING-domain E3-ubiquitin ligase TRIM24 that targets p53 for degradation. Depletion of TRIM24, formerly named TIF1$\alpha$, in tumor-derived cells induces p53-dependent apoptosis. In Drosophila, bonus is a single copy gene homologous to the mammalian Tif1 family. Mosaic deletion of bonus induces cell death in vivo, which is rescued by depletion of D-p53. Bonus is the first identified regulator of p53 protein levels in Drosophila, which lacks an ortholog of Mdm2. TRIM24/bonus may be the ancestral precursor of the large group ...},

abstract = {High lactate generation and low glucose oxidation, despite normal oxygen conditions, are commonly seen in cancer cells and tumors. Historically known as the Warburg effect, this altered metabolic phenotype has long been correlated with malignant progression and poor clinical outcome. However, the mechanistic relationship between altered glucose metabolism and malignancy remains poorly understood. Here we show that inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) activity contributes to the Warburg metabolic and malignant phenotype in human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. PDC inhibition occurs via enhanced expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK-1), which results in inhibitory phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase alpha (PDHalpha) subunit. We also demonstrate that PDC inhibition in cancer cells is associated with normoxic stabilization of the malignancy-promoting transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) by glycolytic metabolites. Knockdown of PDK-1 via short hairpin RNA lowers PDHalpha phosphorylation, restores PDC activity, reverts the Warburg metabolic phenotype, decreases normoxic HIF-1alpha expression, lowers hypoxic cell survival, decreases invasiveness, and inhibits tumor growth. PDK-1 is an HIF-1-regulated gene, and these data suggest that the buildup of glycolytic metabolites, resulting from high PDK-1 expression, may in turn promote HIF-1 activation, thus sustaining a feed-forward loop for malignant progression. In addition to providing anabolic support for cancer cells, altered fuel metabolism thus supports a malignant phenotype. Correction of metabolic abnormalities offers unique opportunities for cancer treatment and may potentially synergize with other cancer therapies.},

Here, we provide evidence that the ligand-dependent nuclear receptor co-regulator Trim24 (also known as Tif1alpha) functions in mice as a liver-specific tumor suppressor. In Trim24-null mice, hepatocytes fail to execute proper cell cycle withdrawal during the neonatal-to-adult transition and continue to cycle in adult livers, becoming prone to a continuum of cellular alterations that progress toward metastatic HCC. Using pharmacological approaches, we show that inhibition of retinoic acid signaling markedly reduces hepatocyte proliferation in Trim24-/- mice. We further show that deletion of a single retinoic acid receptor alpha (Rara) allele in a Trim24-null background suppresses HCC development and restores wild-type expression of retinoic acid-responsive genes in the liver, thus demonstrating that in this genetic background Rara expresses an oncogenic activity correlating with a dysregulation of the retinoic acid signaling pathway. Our results not only provide genetic evidence that Trim24 and Rara co-regulate hepatocarcinogenesis in an antagonistic manner but also suggest that aberrant activation of Rara is deleterious to liver homeostasis.},

abstract = {Autophagy is a highly conserved process involved in lymphocyte development and differentiation. Herein, we demonstrated for the first time that triggering of TRPV1 by the specific agonist CPS induces autophagy in mouse thymocytes. TRPV1-dependent autophagy required [Ca(2+)](i) and ROS generation, resulting in AMPK activation. CPS specifically increased Atg4C mRNA expression and induced oxidation of Atg4C protein by ROS generation. TRPV1-triggered autophagy was Atg6/Beclin-1-dependent, as demonstrated by the use of Beclin-1(+/-) transgenic mice, and involved ROS- and AMPK-mediated up-regulation of Beclin-1 expression. Autophagy is activated as a prosurvival process, as its inhibition triggered apoptosis of thymocytes: this effect was accompanied by down-regulation of Atg4C, Bcl-X(L), and Irgm1 mRNA expression, decreased Bcl-X(L) and Beclin-1 protein levels, and caspase-3 activation, suggesting the existence of a molecular interplay between autophagic and apoptotic programs. TRPV1 activation by CPS altered the expression of CD4 and CD8$\alpha$ antigens, inducing the development of DP(dull). Interestingly, we found that CPS induces autophagy of DP(dull) cells, and inhibition of CPS-induced autophagy by the 3-MA autophagic inhibitor induces apoptosis of DP(dull) cells, suggesting the presence of an interplay between autophagic survival and apoptotic cell death. Overall, our findings suggest that DP(dull) cells constitute a distinct thymocyte subpopulation involved in the homeostatic control of cellularity and in the responses to chemical stress signals during thymocyte maturation, via regulating autophagy and apoptosis in a TRPV1-dependent manner.},

Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of primary rat adipose cells shows co-localization of myc-p49 with GLUT4 and also with the ER-resident protein calnexin. Insulin stimulation had no effect on GLUT4-binding and subcellular distribution of p49 in adipose cells. However, overexpression of the GLUT4-binding domain of p49 in adipose cells reduces protein synthesis and cell-surface expression of GLUT4, but not of GLUT8. Moreover, cell-surface expression of a p49-binding-deficient GLUT4 mutant (ED/QN) is also reduced. Kinetic analysis of HA-epitope-tagged GLUT4 protein synthesis indicates a possible role of p49 in biosynthesis and/or processing of GLUT4 in adipose cells.},

Two basic metabolites that exemplify these differences through increased uptake and altered metabolic usage are glucose and glutamine. These molecules can be catabolized to manufacture many of the building blocks required for active cell growth and proliferation. The alterations in the metabolic pathways necessary to sustain this growth have been linked to therapeutic resistance, a trait that is correlated with poor patient outcomes. By targeting the metabolic pathways that import, catabolize, and synthesize essential cellular components, drug-resistant cancer cells can often be resensitized to anticancer treatments. The specificity and efficacy of agents directed at the unique aspects of cancer metabolism are expected to be high; and may, when in used in combination with more traditional therapeutics, present a pathway to surmount resistance within tumors that no longer respond to current forms of treatment.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs with specific regulatory role in gene expression. Recent reports suggested their involvement in human malignancies. Currently, there is no information concerning miRNA expression and functions in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of tongue. In this study, we evaluated the expression patterns of 156 mature miRNAs in tongue SCC using Taqman-based microRNA assays. Of these 156 miRNAs, miR-133a and miR-133b were significantly reduced in tongue SCC cells in comparison with the paired normal epithelial cells. Tongue SCC cell lines transfected with miR-133a and miR-133b precursors displayed reduction in proliferation rate. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells was increased in response to the introduction of precursors. Computational target gene prediction suggested that both miR-133a and miR-133b are targeting transcript of pyruvate kinase type M2 (PKM2), a potential oncogene in solid cancers. In tongue SCC cell lines, PKM2 expression was reduced in response to miR-133a and miR-133b precursors transfection. Immunohistochemical staining results of tongue SCC tissues suggested that PKM2 was overexpressed in tongue SCC and was associated with the downregulation of miR-133a and miR-133b. Our results suggested that aberrant reduction of miR-133a and miR-133b was associated with the dysregulation of PKM2 in SCC of tongue.},

abstract = {Glucose metabolism is vital to most mammalian cells, and the passage of glucose across cell membranes is facilitated by a family of integral membrane transporter proteins, the GLUTs. There are currently 14 members of the SLC2 family of GLUTs, several of which have been the focus of this series of reviews. The subject of the present review is GLUT3, which, as implied by its name, was the third glucose transporter to be cloned (Kayano T, Fukumoto H, Eddy RL, Fan YS, Byers MG, Shows TB, Bell GI. J Biol Chem 263: 15245-15248, 1988) and was originally designated as the neuronal GLUT. The overriding question that drove the early work on GLUT3 was why would neurons need a separate glucose transporter isoform? What is it about GLUT3 that specifically suits the needs of the highly metabolic and oxidative neuron with its high glucose demand? More recently, GLUT3 has been studied in other cell types with quite specific requirements for glucose, including sperm, preimplantation embryos, circulating white blood cells, and an array of carcinoma cell lines. The last are sufficiently varied and numerous to warrant a review of their own and will not be discussed here. However, for each of these cases, the same questions apply. Thus, the objective of this review is to discuss the properties and tissue and cellular localization of GLUT3 as well as the features of expression, function, and regulation that distinguish it from the rest of its family and make it uniquely suited as the mediator of glucose delivery to these specific cells.},

abstract = {Transendothelial migration is a crucial process of the metastatic cascade in which a malignant cell attaches itself to the endothelial layer forming the inner wall of a blood or lymph vessel and creates a gap through which it enters into the bloodstream (or lymphatic system) and then is transported to distant parts of the body. In this process both biological pathways involving cell adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin and N-cadherin, and the biophysical properties of the cells play an important role. In this paper, we present one of the first mathematical models considering the problem of cancer cell intravasation. We use an individual force-based multi-scale approach which accounts for intra- and inter-cellular protein pathways and for the physical properties of the cells, and a modelling framework which accounts for the biological shape of the vessel. Using our model, we study the influence of different protein pathways in the achievement of transendothelial migration and give quantitative simulation results comparable with real experiments.},

abstract = {Previously, we demonstrated that A549, a human lung cancer cell line, could be adapted to the free radical nitric oxide (NO●). NO● is known to be over expressed in human tumors. The original cell line, A549 (parent), and the newly adapted A549-HNO (which has a more aggressive phenotype) serve as a useful model system to study the biology of NO●. To see if tumor cells can similarly be adapted to any free radical with the same outcome, herein we successfully adapted A549 cells to high levels of hydrogen peroxide (HHP). A549-HHP, the resulting cell line, was more resistant and grew better then the parent cell line, and showed the following characteristics: (1) resistance to hydrogen peroxide, (2) resistance to NO●, (3) growth with and without hydrogen peroxide, and (4) resistance to doxorubicin. Gene chip analysis was used to determine the global gene expression changes between A549-parent and A549-HHP and revealed significant changes in the expression of over 1,700 genes. This gene profile was markedly different from that obtained from the A549-HNO cell line. The mitochondrial DNA content of the A549-HHP line determined by quantitative PCR favored a change for a more anaerobic metabolic profile. Our findings suggest that any free radical can induce resistance to other free radicals; this is especially important given that radiation therapy and many chemotherapeutic agents exert their effect via free radicals. Utilizing this model system to better understand the role of free radicals in tumor biology will help to develop new therapeutic approaches to treat lung cancer.},

abstract = {A new liposome-based near-infrared probe that combines both imaging and targeting abilities was developed for application in medical imaging. The near-infrared fluorescent molecule indocyanine green (ICG), and the cetuximab monoclonal antibody for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were attached to liposomes by passive adsorption. It was found that ICG molecules adsorbed to the liposomes are more fluorescent than free ICG and have a larger quantum yield. Cetuximab-adsorbed fluorescent liposomes preserved EGFR recognition, as is evident from internalization and selective binding to A431 colon carcinoma cells overexpressing EGFR. The binding of cetuximab-targeted fluorescent liposomes to A431 compared with IEC-6 cells (normal enterocytes expressing physiological EGFR levels) was greater by a factor of 3.5, ensuring imaging abilities with available fluorescent equipment. Due to relatively high quantum yield and specific tumor cell-recognizing ability, this technology deserves further in vivo evaluation for imaging and diagnostic purposes.

abstract = {RNAseq and microarray methods are frequently used to measure gene expression level. While similar in purpose, there are fundamental differences between the two technologies. Here, we present the largest comparative study between microarray and RNAseq methods to date using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found high correlations between expression data obtained from the Affymetrix one-channel microarray and RNAseq (Spearman correlations coefficients of ∼0.8). We also observed that the low abundance genes had poorer correlations between microarray and RNAseq data than high abundance genes. As expected, due to measurement and normalization differences, Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data were poorly correlated (Spearman correlations coefficients of only ∼0.2). By examining the differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples we observed reasonable concordance in directionality between Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data, although a small group of genes were found to have expression changes reported in opposite directions using these two technologies. Overall, RNAseq produces comparable results to microarray technologies in term of expression profiling. The RNAseq normalization methods RPKM and RSEM produce similar results on the gene level and reasonably concordant results on the exon level. Longer exons tended to have better concordance between the two normalization methods than shorter exons.},

abstract = {In skeletal muscle, both insulin and muscle contractions mediate translocation of glucose transporter GLUT4 to the plasma membrane proper, the sarcolemma, and the specialized membrane channel network, the transverse (t)-tubules. Despite the fact that skeletal muscle glucose uptake plays a major role in normal conditions, in insulin resistance, and type II diabetes, the details of GLUT4 translocation and the intracellular signalling involved have not been fully described. A main reason is that the majority of experiments have been carried out in muscle cultures in vitro. In vitro cultured muscle is not fully differentiated and, therefore, diverges from real muscle, in that it has lower expression of GLUT4, an underdeveloped or nonexistent t-tubule network, and a reduced or nonexistent response to insulin. Thus, experiments carried out in cultured muscle cell systems might give misleading results on how GLUT4 translocation and the signalling involved takes place. To address this problem, a confocal imaging technique has been developed that allows delineation of the spartial and spatial distribution of GFP-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4-GFP) translocation in living muscle fibers in situ in anesthetized mice. The effects of stimuli with insulin or in situ muscle contractions in fully differentiated muscle fibers can now be studied before, during, and after applying stimuli. Initial analysis of insulin-stimulated GLUT4-GFP translocation showed a delay in maximal translocation between the sarcolemma and t-tubules. Corresponding to the delay, we found that fluorescent tagged insulin reaches the sarcolemma first and then, with a delay, diffuses into the t-tubule system, enabling interaction with local insulin receptors and, in turn, triggering local insulin signalling and local GLUT4 translocation. In parallel, we showed that the majority of GLUT4 depot vesicles do not move long distances but are depleted locally in the sarcolemma or t-tubule regions. Analysis of GLUT4 translocation in insulin-resistant muscle showed that, primarily, GLUT4 recruitment in the t-tubule region is affected. We have now analysed the kinetics of contraction-mediated GLUT4 translocation and reinternalization, as well as dilineated some of the key signalling points involved in these processes.},

abstract = {It is increasingly apparent that cancer development depends not only on genetic alterations, but also on epigenetic changes involving histone modifications. GASC1, member of the histone demethylases affecting heterochromatin formation and transcriptional repression, has been found to be dysregulation in many types of cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, metastatic lung sarcomatoid carcinoma, and leukemia. In this study, we examined the expression of GASC1 and certain GASC1-targeted genes (KLF4, MYC, SOX2, PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG) and identified a three-gene prognostic signature (PPARG, MDM2, and NANOG), using risk scores based on immunohistochemical analyses of 149 tumor specimens from patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The presence of a high-risk three-gene signature in the ESCC tumors was significantly associated with decreased overall survival (OS) of the patients. We validated the predictive value of the three-gene signature in a second independent cohort of 101 patients with ESCC in order to determine whether it had predictive value. The results were similar to those in 149 patients. According to multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses, the predictive model of a three-gene signature was an independent predictor for OS (p = 0.005 in cohort 1, p = 0.025 in cohort 2). In addition, ROC analysis indicated that the predictive ability of the three-gene model was more robust than that of a single biomarker. Therefore, our three-gene signature is closely associated with OS among patients with ESCC and may serve as a predictor for the poor prognosis of ESCC patients.},

abstract = {Fatty acid synthase (FASN) is the biosynthetic enzyme responsible for the endogenous synthesis of fatty acids. It is downregulated in most normal cells, except in lipogenic tissues such as liver, lactating breast, fetal lung and adipose tissue. Conversely, several human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), overexpress FASN, which has been associated with poor prognosis and recently suggested as a metabolic oncoprotein. Orlistat is an irreversible inhibitor of FASN activity with cytotoxic properties on several cancer cell lines that inhibits tumor progression and metastasis in prostate cancer xenografts and experimental melanomas, respectively. To explore whether the inhibition of FASN could impact oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) metastatic spread, an orthotopic model was developed by the implantation of SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells into the tongue of BALB/c nude mice. These cells were isolated through in vivo selection, show a more invasive behavior in vitro than the parental cells, and generate orthotopic tumors that spontaneously metastasize to cervical lymph nodes in 10-15 days only. SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells also exhibit enhanced production of MMP-2, ERBB2, and CDH2. The treatment with orlistat reduced proliferation and migration, promoted apoptosis and stimulated the secretion of VEGFA165b by SCC-9 ZsGreen LN-1 cells. In vivo, the drug was able to decrease both the volume and proliferation indexes of the tongue orthotopic tumors and, importantly, reduced the number of metastatic cervical lymph nodes by 43{\%}. These results suggest that FASN is a potential molecular target for the chemotherapy of OTSCC patients.},

EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor alpha are also overexpressed in HNSCC. EGFR plays a critical role in HNSCC growth, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, EGFR inhibitors as monotherapy have yielded only modest clinical outcomes. Potential mechanisms for lack of response to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC include constitutive activation of signaling pathways independent of EGFR, as well as genetic aberrations causing dysregulation of the cell cycle. EGFR-directed therapy may be optimized by identifying and selecting those HNSCC patients most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition.

abstract = {The combination of irradiated fibroblast feeder cells and Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, conditionally induces an indefinite proliferative state in primary mammalian epithelial cells. These conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) are karyotype-stable and nontumorigenic. Because self-renewal is a recognized property of stem cells, we investigated whether Y-27632 and feeder cells induced a stem-like phenotype. We found that CRCs share characteristics of adult stem cells and exhibit up-regulated expression of $\alpha$6 and $\beta$1 integrins, $\Delta$Np63$\alpha$, CD44, and telomerase reverse transcriptase, as well as decreased Notch signaling and an increased level of nuclear $\beta$-catenin. The induction of CRCs is rapid (occurs within 2 d) and results from reprogramming of the entire cell population rather than the selection of a minor subpopulation. CRCs do not overexpress the transcription factor sets characteristic of embryonic or induced pluripotent stem cells (e.g., Sox2, Oct4, Nanog, or Klf4). The induction of CRCs is also reversible, and removal of Y-27632 and feeders allows the cells to differentiate normally. Thus, when CRCs from ectocervical epithelium or tracheal epithelium are placed in an air-liquid interface culture system, the cervical cells form a well differentiated stratified squamous epithelium, whereas the tracheal cells form a ciliated airway epithelium. We discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities afforded by a method that can generate adult stem-like cells in vitro without genetic manipulation.},

Unlike in normal cells, glycolysis is enhanced and OXPHOS capacity is reduced in various cancer cells.

This view is challenged by recent investigations which find that the function of mitochondrial OXPHOS in most cancers is intact. Aerobic glycolysis in many cancers is the combined result of various factors such as oncogenes, tumor suppressors, a hypoxic microenvironment, mtDNA mutations, genetic background and others. Understanding the features and complexity of the cancer energy metabolism will help to develop new approaches in early diagnosis and effectively target therapy of cancer.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: GLUT4 is the predominant glucose transporter isoform expressed in fat and muscle. In GLUT4 null mice, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle was diminished but not eliminated, suggesting that another insulin-sensitive system was present. OBJECTIVE: This study was intended to determine whether insulin caused GLUT12 translocation in muscle. DESIGN: Six normal volunteers had muscle biopsies before and after euglycemic insulin infusions. SETTING: Infusions and biopsies were performed in an outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were nonobese, young adults with no family history of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GLUT12, GLUT4, and GLUT1 proteins were quantified in muscle biopsy fractions. Cultured myoblasts were used to determine whether GLUT12 translocation was phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase (PI3-K)-dependent. INTERVENTION: Insulin was infused at 40 mU/m(2) x min for 3 h. RESULTS: In human muscle, insulin caused a shift of a portion of GLUT12 from intracellular low-density microsomes to the plasma membrane (PM) fraction (17{\%} in PM at baseline, 38{\%} in PM after insulin). Insulin increased GLUT4 in PM from 13 to 42{\%}. GLUT1 was predominantly in the PM fractions at baseline and did not change significantly after insulin. L6 myoblasts in culture also expressed and translocated GLUT12 in response to insulin, but inhibiting PI3-K prevented the translocation of GLUT12 and GLUT4. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin causes GLUT12 to translocate from an intracellular location to the plasma membrane in normal human skeletal muscle. Translocation of GLUT12 in cultured myoblasts was dependent on activation of PI3-K. GLUT12 may have evolutionarily preceded GLUT4 and now provides redundancy to the dominant GLUT4 system in muscle.},

abstract = {Resistance to cisplatin is a major obstacle to successful treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To investigate the molecular mechanism of this resistance, we compared the gene expression profiles between the cisplatin-sensitive SCC cell lines (Sa-3, H-1 and KB) and the cisplatin-resistant cell lines established from them (Sa-3R, H-1R and KB-R) using Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 microarray. We identified 199 genes differentially expressed in each group. To identify important functional networks and ontologies to cisplatin resistance, the 199 genes were analyzed using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Tool. Fifty-one of these genes were mapped to genetic networks, and we validated the top-10 upregulated genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Five novel genes, LUM, PDE3B, PDGF-C, NRG1 and PKD2, showed excellent concordance with the microarray data. In 48 patients with oral SCC (OSCC), positive immunohistochemical staining for the five genes correlated with chemoresistance to cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy. In addition, the expression of the five genes predicted the patient outcomes with chemotherapy. Furthermore, siRNA-directed suppressed expression of the five genes resulted in enhanced susceptibility to cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. These results suggested that these five novel genes have great potential for predicting the efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy against OSCC. Global gene analysis of cisplatin-resistant cell lines may provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying clinical cisplatin resistance and improve the efficacy of chemotherapy for human HNSCC.},

abstract = {Endothelial dysfunction comprises a number of functional alterations in the vascular endothelium that are associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, including changes in vasoregulation, enhanced generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, inflammatory activation, and altered barrier function. Hyperglycemia is a characteristic feature of type 1 and type 2 diabetes and plays a pivotal role in diabetes-associated microvascular complications. Although hyperglycemia also contributes to the occurrence and progression of macrovascular disease (the major cause of death in type 2 diabetes), other factors such as dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, and adipose-tissue-derived factors play a more dominant role. A mutual interaction between these factors and endothelial dysfunction occurs during the progression of the disease. We pay special attention to the possible involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress) and the role of obesity and adipose-derived adipokines as contributors to endothelial dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. The close interaction of adipocytes of perivascular adipose tissue with arteries and arterioles facilitates the exposure of their endothelial cells to adipokines, particularly if inflammation activates the adipose tissue and thus affects vasoregulation and capillary recruitment in skeletal muscle. Hence, an initial dysfunction of endothelial cells underlies metabolic and vascular alterations that contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes.},

abstract = {Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF-2 alpha) is typically associated with stress responses and causes a reduction in protein synthesis. However, we found high phosphorylated eIF-2 alpha (eIF-2 alpha[P]) levels in nonstressed pancreata of mice. Administration of glucose stimulated a rapid dephosphorylation of eIF-2 alpha. Among the four eIF-2 alpha kinases present in mammals, PERK is most highly expressed in the pancreas, suggesting that it may be responsible for the high eIF-2 alpha[P] levels found therein. We describe a Perk knockout mutation in mice. Pancreata of Perk(-/-) mice are morphologically and functionally normal at birth, but the islets of Langerhans progressively degenerate, resulting in loss of insulin-secreting beta cells and development of diabetes mellitus, followed later by loss of glucagon-secreting alpha cells. The exocrine pancreas exhibits a reduction in the synthesis of several major digestive enzymes and succumbs to massive apoptosis after the fourth postnatal week. Perk(-/-) mice also exhibit skeletal dysplasias at birth and postnatal growth retardation. Skeletal defects include deficient mineralization, osteoporosis, and abnormal compact bone development. The skeletal and pancreatic defects are associated with defects in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of the major secretory cells that comprise the skeletal system and pancreas. The skeletal, pancreatic, and growth defects are similar to those seen in human Wolcott-Rallison syndrome.},

abstract = {Glucose is the main source of energy for the body, requiring constant regulation of its blood concentration. Insulin release by the pancreas induces glucose uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues, most notably the brain, skeletal muscle, and adipocytes. Patients suffering from type-2 diabetes and/or obesity often develop insulin resistance and are unable to control their glucose homeostasis. New insights into the mechanisms of insulin resistance may provide new treatment strategies for type-2 diabetes. The GLUT family of glucose transporters consists of thirteen members distributed on different tissues throughout the body. Glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) is the major transporter that mediates glucose uptake by insulin sensitive tissues, such as the skeletal muscle. Upon binding of insulin to its receptor, vesicles containing GLUT4 translocate from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, inducing glucose uptake. Reduced GLUT4 translocation is one of the causes of insulin resistance in type-2 diabetes. The translocation of GLUT4 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane can be visualized by immunocytochemistry, using fluorophore-conjugated GLUT4-specific antibodies. Here, we describe a technique to quantify total amounts of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of cells during a chosen duration, using flow cytometry. This protocol is rapid (less than 4 hours, including incubation with insulin) and allows the analysis of as few as 3,000 cells or as many as 1 million cells per condition in a single experiment. It relies on anti-GLUT4 antibodies directed to an external epitope of the transporter that bind to it as soon as it is exposed to the extracellular medium after translocation to the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular biomarkers are essential for monitoring treatment effects, predicting prognosis, and improving survival rate in oral squamous cell carcinoma. This study sought to verify the effectiveness of two integrin gene expression ratios as biomarkers.

METHODS: Gene expression analyses of integrin $\alpha$3 (ITGA3), integrin $\beta$4 (ITGB4), CD9 antigen (CD9), and plakoglobin (JUP) by quantitative real-time PCR were conducted on total RNA from 270 OSCC cases. The logrank test, Cox proportional hazards model, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were performed on the gene expression ratios of ITGA3/CD9 and ITGB4/JUP and on the clinicopathological parameters for major clinical events.

RESULTS: A high rate (around 80{\%}) of lymph node metastasis was found in cases with a high ITGA3/CD9 ratio (high-ITGA3/CD9) and invasive histopathology (YK4). Primary site recurrence (PSR) was associated with high-ITGA3/CD9, T3-4 (TNM class), and positive margin, indicating that PSR is synergistically influenced by treatment failure and biological malignancy. A high ITGB4/JUP ratio (high-ITGB4/JUP) was revealed to be a primary contributor to distant metastasis without the involvement of clinicopathological factors, suggesting intervention of a critical step dependent on the function of the integrin $\beta$4 subunit. Kaplan-Meier curves revealed positive margin as a lethal treatment consequence in high-ITGA3/CD9 and YK4 double-positive cases.

CONCLUSION: Two types of metastatic trait were found in OSCC: locoregional dissemination, which was reflected by high-ITGA3/CD9, and distant metastasis through hematogenous dissemination, uniquely distinguished by high-ITGB4/JUP. The clinical significance of the integrin biomarkers implies that biological mechanisms such as cancer cell motility and anchorage-independent survival are vital for OSCC recurrence and metastasis.},

Otto Warburg observed that aerobic glycolysis was a characteristic of cancer cells. More than 50 years later, we understand that aerobic glycolysis and uptake of glutamine and glycine allow cancer cells to produce energy (ATP) and the nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids required for proliferation. Expression of the MYC oncogene drives the increase in cellular biomass facilitating proliferation. PKM2 expression in cancer cells stimulates aerobic glycolysis. Among intermediary metabolism enzymes, mutations in SDH occur in gastointestinal stromal tumors and result in a pseudohypoxic metabolic milieu. FH mutations lead to a characteristic renal cell carcinoma. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2) mutations have been found in leukemias, gliomas, prostate cancer, colon cancer, thyroid cancer, and sarcomas. These recently recognized oncogenic metabolic lesions may be selective targets for new anticancer therapeutics.},

abstract = {Today still only 50{\%} of newly diagnosed cancers can be cured. While molecular mechanisms of cell proliferation are being studied intensively, comparably little research energy, however, has been spent on unravelling metabolic interactions of cancer and host tissues. Evidence is accumulating that systemic as well as local metabolic patterns have considerable impact on tumour growth, as well as on body composition and organ functions. This may lead to new treatments in oncology. Cancer development - and recurrence - may be inhibited by physical activity, as well as by avoiding obesity, the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Antineoplastic treatments induce reductions in nutritional intake and require individually tailored nutritional support. New concepts are being considered to metabolically starve or reprogram cancer cells. During palliative treatment of progressive tumours, it should be good clinical practice to avoid or treat malnutrition and chronic inflammatory states. At late stages, the primary goal should be symptomatic relief and attention to subjective individual needs.

abstract = {Mitochondria play a central role not only in energy production but also in the integration of metabolic pathways as well as signals for apoptosis and autophagy. It is becoming increasingly apparent that mitochondria in mammalian cells play critical roles in the initiation and propagation of various signaling cascades. In particular, mitochondrial metabolic and respiratory states and status on mitochondrial genetic instability are communicated to the nucleus as an adaptive response through retrograde signaling. Each mammalian cell contains multiple copies of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). A reduction in mtDNA copy number has been reported in various human pathological conditions such as diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative disorders, aging and cancer. Reduction in mtDNA copy number disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential ($\Delta$$\psi$m) resulting in dysfunctional mitochondria. Dysfunctional mitochondria trigger retrograde signaling and communicate their changing metabolic and functional state to the nucleus as an adaptive response resulting in an altered nuclear gene expression profile and altered cell physiology and morphology. In this review, we provide an overview of the various modes of mitochondrial retrograde signaling focusing particularly on the Ca(2+)/Calcineurin mediated retrograde signaling. We discuss the contribution of the key factors of the pathway such as Calcineurin, IGF1 receptor, Akt kinase and HnRNPA2 in the propagation of signaling and their role in modulating genetic and epigenetic changes favoring cellular reprogramming towards tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {Vimentin, a major constituent of the intermediate filament family of proteins, is ubiquitously expressed in normal mesenchymal cells and is known to maintain cellular integrity and provide resistance against stress. Vimentin is overexpressed in various epithelial cancers, including prostate cancer, gastrointestinal tumors, tumors of the central nervous system, breast cancer, malignant melanoma, and lung cancer. Vimentin's overexpression in cancer correlates well with accelerated tumor growth, invasion, and poor prognosis; however, the role of vimentin in cancer progression remains obscure. In recent years, vimentin has been recognized as a marker for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Although EMT is associated with several tumorigenic events, vimentin's role in the underlying events mediating these processes remains unknown. By virtue of its overexpression in cancer and its association with tumor growth and metastasis, vimentin serves as an attractive potential target for cancer therapy; however, more research would be crucial to evaluate its specific role in cancer. Our recent discovery of a vimentin-binding mini-peptide has generated further impetus for vimentin-targeted tumor-specific therapy. Furthermore, research directed toward elucidating the role of vimentin in various signaling pathways would reveal new approaches for the development of therapeutic agents. This review summarizes the expression and functions of vimentin in various types of cancer and suggests some directions toward future cancer therapy utilizing vimentin as a potential molecular target.},

abstract = {Anthocyanins are a group of naturally occurring phenolic compounds widely available in fruits and vegetables in human diets. They have broad biological activities including anti-mutagenesis and anticarcinogenesis, which are generally attributed to their antioxidant activities. We studied the effects and the mechanisms of the most common type of anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, in several leukemia and lymphoma cell lines. We found that cyanidin-3-rutinoside extracted and purified from the black raspberry cultivar Jewel induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Paradoxically, this compound induced the accumulation of peroxides, which are involved in the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In addition, cyanidin-3-rutinoside treatment resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, which contributed to cell death by activating the mitochondrial pathway mediated by Bim. Down-regulation of Bim or overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) considerably blocked apoptosis. Notably, cyanidin-3-rutinoside treatment did not lead to increased ROS accumulation in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and had no cytotoxic effects on these cells. These results indicate that cyanidin-3-rutinoside has the potential to be used in leukemia therapy with the advantages of being widely available and selective against tumors.},

Oncogene addiction, that is, the acquired dependence of a cancer cell on the activity of a single oncogenic gene product, has been the basis for the targeted therapy paradigm, and operationally defines such signals. Additionally, cancer cells have altered metabolic requirements that create addictions to specific nutrients such as glucose and glutamine. In this review, I will discuss the therapeutic opportunities that these two types of molecular addictions offer, focusing on lessons learned from targeting members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of kinases, and components of MAPK pathway. I will also discuss the challenges in simultaneously harnessing two types of molecular addictions for therapeutic benefit, and the importance of understanding not only the effects of oncogenic signal transduction on metabolism, but also the impact of metabolic states on signal transduction.},

However, the effect of TPL on oral cancers is not yet evaluated. Herein we first demonstrate that TPL induces prominent growth inhibition and apoptosis in two oral cancer cell lines, SCC25 and OEC-M1 and in KB cells. Our results indicate that TPL induces a dose-dependent apoptosis of these cells at nanomolar concentration. Apoptosis signalings are both activated through time upon TPL treatment detected by elevated caspase-3, 8, 9 activities. In xenograft tumor mouse model, TPL injection successfully inhibits the tumor growth via apoptosis induction which was demonstrated by TUNEL assay. These results demonstrate that TPL exerts anti-tumor effect on oral cancer and KB cells and suggest further the potential of TPL combining with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy for advanced oral cancer.},

abstract = {The functioning and survival of mammalian cells requires an active energy metabolism. Metabolic dysfunction plays an important role in many human diseases, including diabetes, cancer, inherited mitochondrial disorders, and metabolic syndrome. The monosaccharide glucose constitutes a key source of cellular energy. Following its import across the plasma membrane, glucose is converted into pyruvate by the glycolysis pathway. Pyruvate oxidation supplies substrates for the ATP-generating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system. To gain cell-biochemical knowledge about the operation and regulation of the cellular energy metabolism in the healthy and diseased state, quantitative knowledge is required about (changes in) metabolite concentrations under (non) steady-state conditions. This information can, for instance, be used to construct more realistic in silico models of cell metabolism, which facilitates understanding the consequences of metabolic dysfunction as well as on- and off-target effects of mitochondrial drugs. Here we review the current state-of-the-art live-cell quantification of two key cellular metabolites, glucose and ATP, using protein-based sensors. The latter apply the principle of FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) and allow measurements in different cell compartments by fluorescence microscopy. We further summarize the properties and applications of the FRET-based sensors, their calibration, pitfalls, and future perspectives.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Although 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) has been predominately linked to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, it may also evoke additional signaling outputs to promote tumorigenesis. Here, we report that PDK1 directly induces phosphorylation of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), which in turn induces MYC phosphorylation and protein accumulation. We show that PDK1-PLK1-MYC signaling is critical for cancer cell growth and survival, and small-molecule inhibition of PDK1/PLK1 provides an effective approach for therapeutic targeting of MYC dependency. Intriguingly, PDK1-PLK1-MYC signaling induces an embryonic stem cell-like gene signature associated with aggressive tumor behaviors and is a robust signaling axis driving cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal. Finally, we show that a PLK1 inhibitor synergizes with an mTOR inhibitor to induce synergistic antitumor effects in colorectal cancer by antagonizing compensatory MYC induction. These findings identify a novel pathway in human cancer and CSC activation and provide a therapeutic strategy for targeting MYC-associated tumorigenesis and therapeutic resistance.

SIGNIFICANCE: This work identifies PDK1–PLK1-MYC signaling as a new oncogenic pathway driving oncogenic transformation and CSC self-renewal. Targeted inhibition of PDK1/PLK1 is robust in targeting MYC dependency in cancer cells. Thus, our findings provide important insights into cancer and CSC biology and have significant therapeutic implications.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Molecular analysis of surgical margins is playing an increasingly important role in establishing surgical margins. Most markers lack the sensitivity and ease of applicability for effective clinical use. To date, the proto-oncogene eIF4E (4E) is elevated in 100{\%} of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma tumors and is of prognostic value in predicting recurrence. In a retrospective study, 4E overexpression in the margins appeared to be a more sensitive predictor of recurrence when compared with p53. The goal was to confirm this finding in a prospective study and also to compare the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to 4E expression in tumors and margins. Other objectives were to determine which of these markers have prognostic significance in predicting recurrence and elucidate whether there is any additional benefit to analysis of surgical margins with a combination of the three molecular markers. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study was performed on all patients who consecutively underwent primary surgical resection between 1998 and 1999 for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Patient and tumor characteristics were reviewed, and time to recurrence was noted. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded sections of tumors and all histologically tumor-free margins were analyzed for the presence or absence of 4E, p53, and MMP-9 with immunohistochemical analysis. Patients were followed according to the institution's head and neck cancer protocol, and time to recurrence was noted. RESULTS: Ninety-eight percent of tumors overexpressed 4E, 65{\%} overexpressed p53, and 92{\%} overexpressed MMP-9. Of the 52 patients with tumor-free margins, 52{\%}, 46{\%}, and 54{\%} had positive margins for 4E, p53, and MMP-9, respectively. Although no significant correlation between 4E and p53 expression was seen in the margins (P =.16), a significant correlation between 4E and MMP-9 expression was noted (P =.0002). However, when expression of 4E and p53 in the margins of only the patients who overexpressed p53 in the tumors was compared (n = 34), there was a significant correlation (P =.04). There was also a significant difference in the disease-free interval between patients with 4E-positive and 4E-negative margins (P =.003). This difference in time to recurrence was not significant for the p53-positive versus the p53-negative group (P =.18) but approached significance when MMP-9 was used as a marker (P =.07). Although the univariate analysis showed that stage, nodal disease, grade, and 4E expression in the margins were significantly associated with disease-free interval, in the Cox multiple regression analysis, only 4E expression in the margin was significantly associated with disease-free interval (P =.01). CONCLUSIONS: The era for molecular analysis of surgical margins is here. Although a significant correlation was seen between 4E and MMP-9, overexpression of 4E appears to be a significant predictor of recurrence when compared with the well-studied tumor suppressor gene p53 and a relatively novel marker, MMP-9.},

BACKGROUND: Over 90{\%} of adults aged 20 years or older with permanent teeth have suffered from dental caries leading to pain, infection, or even tooth loss. Although caries prevalence has decreased over the past decade, there are still about 23{\%} of dentate adults who have untreated carious lesions in the US. Dental caries is a complex disorder affected by both individual susceptibility and environmental factors. Approximately 35-55{\%} of caries phenotypic variation in the permanent dentition is attributable to genes, though few specific caries genes have been identified. Therefore, we conducted the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genes affecting susceptibility to caries in adults.

METHODS: Five independent cohorts were included in this study, totaling more than 7000 participants. For each participant, dental caries was assessed and genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) were genotyped or imputed across the entire genome. Due to the heterogeneity among the five cohorts regarding age, genotyping platform, quality of dental caries assessment, and study design, we first conducted genome-wide association (GWA) analyses on each of the five independent cohorts separately. We then performed three meta-analyses to combine results for: (i) the comparatively younger, Appalachian cohorts (N = 1483) with well-assessed caries phenotype, (ii) the comparatively older, non-Appalachian cohorts (N = 5960) with inferior caries phenotypes, and (iii) all five cohorts (N = 7443). Top ranking genetic loci within and across meta-analyses were scrutinized for biologically plausible roles on caries.

RESULTS: Different sets of genes were nominated across the three meta-analyses, especially between the younger and older age cohorts. In general, we identified several suggestive loci (P-value ≤ 10E-05) within or near genes with plausible biological roles for dental caries, including RPS6KA2 and PTK2B, involved in p38-depenedent MAPK signaling, and RHOU and FZD1, involved in the Wnt signaling cascade. Both of these pathways have been implicated in dental caries. ADMTS3 and ISL1 are involved in tooth development, and TLR2 is involved in immune response to oral pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS: As the first GWAS for dental caries in adults, this study nominated several novel caries genes for future study, which may lead to better understanding of cariogenesis, and ultimately, to improved disease predictions, prevention, and/or treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cytogenetic and gene expression analyses in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) have allowed identification of genomic aberrations that may contribute to cancer pathophysiology. Nevertheless, the molecular consequences of numerous genetic alterations still remain unclear.

METHODS: To identify novel genes implicated in HNSCC pathogenesis, we analyzed the genomic alterations present in five HNSCC-derived cell lines by array CGH, and compared high level focal gene amplifications with gene expression levels to identify genes whose expression is directly impacted by these genetic events. Next, we knocked down TRPC6, one of the most highly amplified and over-expressed genes, to characterize the biological roles of TRPC6 in carcinogenesis. Finally, real time PCR was performed to determine TRPC6 gene dosage and mRNA levels in normal mucosa and human HNSCC tissues.

RESULTS: The data showed that the HNSCC-derived cell lines carry most of the recurrent genomic abnormalities previously described in primary tumors. High-level genomic amplifications were found at four chromosomal sites (11q21-q22.2, 18p11.31-p11.21, 19p13.2-p13.13, and 21q11) with associated gene expression changes in selective candidate genes suggesting that they may play an important role in the malignant behavior of HNSCC. One of the most dramatic alterations of gene transcription involved the TRPC6 gene (located at 11q21-q22.2) which has been recently implicated in tumour invasiveness. siRNA-induced knockdown of TRPC6 expression in HNSCC-derived cells dramatically inhibited HNSCC-cell invasion but did not significantly alter cell proliferation. Importantly, amplification and concomitant overexpression of TRPC6 was also found in HNSCC tumour samples.

CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data show that TRPC6 is likely to be a target for 11q21-22.2 amplification that confers enhanced invasive behavior to HNSCC cells. Therefore, TRPC6 may be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of HNSCC.},

abstract = {We previously reported the existence of a truncated isoform of the retinoic acid receptor beta, termed beta prime. Beta prime lacks the N-terminal domains of beta 2 and beta 4, including the DNA-binding domain. However, beta prime is able to heterodimerize and interact with transcription cofactors. To determine the effects of different retinoic acid receptor isoforms on cell proliferation and apoptosis, we transduced retinoid sensitive (MCF7) and retinoid-resistant (MDA-MB-231) cells with retinoic acid receptor beta 2, beta 4, or beta prime. Expression of the truncated beta prime isoform induces resistance to retinoic acid treatment in retinoid sensitive MCF7 cells. In both retinoid sensitive and resistant cells, expression of full-length beta 2 and beta 4 isoforms results in elevated sensitivity to retinoic acid treatment and caspase-independent cell death. Cell death in beta 4 transduced MDA-MB-231 cells was accompanied by metaphase chromosome decondensation and breakage suggestive of mitotic catastrophe. Our results provide evidence that: (a) the truncated form of the retinoic acid receptor beta induces retinoid resistance rather than sensitivity; and (b) alternative pathways of cell death are mediated by different isoforms in breast cancer cells.},

abstract = {Chemoradiation-resistant cancers limit treatment efficacy and safety. We show here the cancer cell-specific, on-demand intracellular amplification of chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy via gold nanoparticle- and laser pulse-induced mechanical intracellular impact. Cancer aggressiveness promotes the clustering of drug nanocarriers and gold nanoparticles in cancer cells. This cluster, upon exposure to a laser pulse, generates a plasmonic nanobubble, the mechanical explosion that destroys the host cancer cell or ejects the drug into its cytoplasm by disrupting the liposome and endosome. The same cluster locally amplifies external X-rays. Intracellular synergy of the mechanical impact of plasmonic nanobubble, ejected drug and amplified X-rays improves the efficacy of standard chemoradiation in resistant and aggressive head and neck cancer by 100-fold in vitro and 17-fold in vivo, reduces the effective entry doses of drugs and X-rays to 2-6{\%} of their clinical doses and efficiently spares normal cells. The developed quadrapeutics technology combines four clinically validated components and transforms a standard macrotherapy into an intracellular on-demand theranostic microtreatment with radically amplified therapeutic efficacy and specificity.},

abstract = {One of the phenotypes of mice with targeted disruption of the uncoupling protein-2 gene (Ucp2−/−) is greater macrophage phagocytic activity and free radical production, resulting in a striking resistance to infectious microorganisms. In this study, the molecular mechanisms of this enhanced immune response were investigated. We found that levels of nitric oxide measured in either plasma or isolated macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice are significantly elevated in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide challenge compared with similarly treated Ucp2+/+ mice. Likewise, expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase and inflammatory cytokines is higher in Ucp2−/− mice in vivo and in vitro. Key steps in the activation cascade of nuclear factor (NF)-$\kappa$B, including I$\kappa$B kinase and nuclear translocation of NF-$\kappa$B subunits, are all remarkably enhanced in Ucp2−/− mice, most notably even under basal conditions. The elevated basal activity of I$\kappa$B kinase in macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice can be blocked by cell-permeable inhibitors of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide generation, but not by a specific inhibitor for inducible nitric-oxide synthase. Isolated mitochondria from Ucp2−/− cells produced more superoxide/hydrogen peroxide. We conclude that mitochrondrially derived reactive oxygen from Ucp2−/− cells constitutively activates NF-$\kappa$B, resulting in a “primed” state to both potentiate and amplify the inflammatory response upon subsequent stimulation. Uncoupling protein (UCP)1-2 is a mitochondrial inner membrane carrier protein that was discovered through its homology to the brown fat UCP1 (1). Whereas UCP1 has been clearly established as the molecular mediator of non-shivering thermogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 2), the function of UCP2 remains somewhat of an enigma. Several features of UCP2 led us to initially propose that it was a bona fide uncoupling protein involved in the dissipation of excess metabolic fuel as heat. These aspects of UCP2 included its structural resemblance to UCP1, its ability to uncouple respiration in model assay systems, and a chromosomal location to a region with genetic linkage to obesity and hyperinsulinemia (1, 3). However, although Ucp2 mRNA is expressed in a broad array of tissues in humans and rodent models (3, 4), including metabolically important organs, it exists in minute amounts compared with the level of UCP1 in brown fat. Moreover, it is present in cell types such as pancreatic $\beta$-cells, lymphocytes, and neurons that are not typically associated with thermogenesis (5–7). These and other features of UCP2 (8), together with the critical finding that targeted disruption of the Ucp2 gene did not result in obesity, cold sensitivity, or demonstrable differences in coupling efficiency in isolated mitochondria (9–11), strongly suggested a functionally distinct role for this protein. One of the phenotypes of Ucp2−/− mice was a striking resistance to infectious microorganisms associated with greater macrophage phagocytic activity and free radical production (9). We showed that macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice produced reactive oxygen species (ROS) using the nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay and hypothesized that UCP2 plays a role in host immune defense by regulating the production of ROS. A broad definition of ROS can include reactive oxygen as well as nitrogen species, and macrophages are known to generate reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as nitric oxide (NO) in addition to superoxide. However, the nitro blue tetrazolium assay cannot distinguish between the ROS and RNS generated (12) or the mechanisms responsible for it. In the present study we explored the molecular basis of this amplified immune response in Ucp2−/− mice using lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a membrane glycolipid of Gram-negative bacteria that is a well-established activator of both the “reactive oxygen” and “reactive nitrogen” generating pathways (13, 14). We show that in response to LPS challenge, Ucp2−/− mice produce large amounts of nitric oxide and cytokines both in vivo and from isolated macrophages in vitro as compared with wild-type mice. As one of the major transcription factors responsible for increasing the expression of iNOS and inflammatory cytokines, we find that in spleen or isolated macrophages of Ucp2−/− mice, the NF-$\kappa$B system is activated at several steps in its pathway (importantly, even under basal conditions). NF-$\kappa$B is most frequently composed of two DNA-binding subunits, p50 and p65, which exist as an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to an inhibitory protein (I$\kappa$B). Almost all of the signals that lead to activation of NF-$\kappa$B converge on I$\kappa$B kinase (IKK). Activation of IKK leads to the phosphorylation of I$\kappa$Bs, which targets them for ubiquitination and degradation, thus allowing the NF-$\kappa$B dimer to translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression (15). In the present study we show that IKK activity is elevated in spleen as well as isolated macrophages from Ucp2−/− mice, even under basal conditions, and isolated mitochondria from Ucp2−/− spleen produce significantly more hydrogen peroxide as compared with wild-type mice. Together with the finding that cell-permeable preparations of the ROS inhibitors superoxide dismutase and catalase could block the basal elevation of IKK activity in isolated macrophages, our results support the idea that deficiency of UCP2 results in greater equation M1 release from mitochondria (16), leading in turn to persistent activation of NF-$\kappa$B and exacerbation of subsequent inflammatory challenges.},

abstract = {A tumour control probability computational model for fractionated radiotherapy was developed, with the goal of incorporating the fundamental interplay between hypoxia and proliferation, including reoxygenation over a course of radiotherapy. The fundamental idea is that the local delivery of oxygen and glucose limits the amount of proliferation and metabolically-supported cell survival a tumour sub-volume can support. The model has three compartments: a proliferating compartment of cells receiving oxygen and glucose; an intermediate, metabolically-active compartment receiving glucose; and a highly hypoxic compartment of starving cells. Following the post-mitotic cell death of proliferating cells, intermediate cells move into the proliferative compartment and hypoxic cells move into the intermediate compartment. A key advantage of the proposed model is that the initial compartmental cell distribution is uniquely determined from the assumed local growth fraction (GF) and volume doubling time (TD) values. Varying initial cell state distributions, based on the local (voxel) GF and TD, were simulated. Tumour response was simulated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma using relevant parameter values based on published sources. The tumour dose required to achieve a 50{\%} local control rate (TCD50) was found for various GFs and TD's, and the effect of fraction size on TCD50 was also evaluated. Due to the advantage of reoxygenation over a course of radiotherapy, conventional fraction sizes (2-2.4 Gy fx(-1)) were predicted to result in smaller TCD50's than larger fraction sizes (4-5 Gy fx(-1)) for a 10 cc tumour with GFs of around 0.15. The time to eliminate hypoxic cells (the reoxygenation time) was estimated for a given GF and decreased as GF increased. The extra dose required to overcome accelerated stem cell accumulation in longer treatment schedules was estimated to be 0.68 Gy/day (in EQD26.6), similar to published values derived from clinical data. The model predicts, for a 2 Gy/weekday fractionation, that increased initial proliferation (high GF) should, surprisingly, lead to moderately higher local control values. Tumour hypoxia is predicted to increase the required dose for local control by approximately 30{\%}. Predicted tumour regression patterns are consistent with clinical observations. This simple yet flexible model shows how the local competition for chemical resources might impact local control rates under varying fractionation conditions.},

abstract = {The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays a critical role in cell proliferation and oncogenesis. It has been found to be chronically activated in a variety of human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Previously, we have found that the activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibits mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In this study, we extended our studies to determine whether the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhibited death receptor-mediated apoptosis in HNSCC cells. We found that Wnt/beta-catenin inhibited not only tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/c-Myc-mediated apoptosis, but also cell detachment-mediated apoptosis (anoikis) which is dependent on the death receptor signaling pathway. Interestingly, we also observed that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway induced HNSCC cell scattering and promoted cell invasion in the Matrigel, both of which are hallmarks for the invasive growth of HNSCC. Consistently, the over-expression of beta-catenin promoted HNSCC tumor growth in nude mice. Taken together, our results suggest that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway plays dual functions in HNSCC development: promoting both cell survival and invasive growth of HNSCC cells.},

STUDY DESIGN: Oral epithelial cells from a 30-week gestational, stillborn male fetus were grown in serum-free medium and transfected by lipid-mediation with the shuttle vector plasmid, pZ189, containing the T-antigen coding region and replication origin from the SV40 virus.

RESULTS: Resulting cultures produced foci of rapidly multiplying cells that failed to senesce, in contrast to controls. The transformed culture, designated GMSM-K, was polyclonal. The original culture possessed a normal human male karyotype, and the transformed line was largely hypotetraploid. Multiple clones, isolated from soft agar studies and low density plating, showed decreased doubling times. Electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry confirmed an epithelial phenotype. Cells did not generate tumors in nude mice.

CONCLUSION: Few human epithelial cell lines are available to investigators and most are tumor-derived. The nontumor-derived GMSM-K line has value as a resource for human oral epithelial cell research.},

The results of the present study showed that cobalt chloride (CoCl₂), a chemical hypoxia agent, markedly induced ROS generation and phosphorylation of p38MAPK, as well as neuronal injuries. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, blocked CoCl₂-induced phosphorylation of p38MAPK. In addition, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38MAPK attenuated not only CoCl₂-induced activation of p38MAPK, but also ROS production. These results suggest that ROS and p38MAPK are capable of interacting positively during chemical hypoxia. Furthermore, NAC and SB203580 markedly prevented CoCl₂-induced cytotoxicity, apoptosis and a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Taken together, our findings suggest that the positive interaction between CoCl₂ induction of ROS and p38MAPK activation may play a significant role in CoCl₂-induced neuronal injuries. We provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for CoCl₂-induced injuries in PC12 cells.},

abstract = {During the last decades a considerable amount of research has been focused on cancer. Recently, tumor cell metabolism has been considered as a possible target for cancer therapy. It is widely accepted that tumors display enhanced glycolytic activity and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (Warburg effect). Therefore, it seems reasonable that disruption of glycolysis might be a promising candidate for specific anti-cancer therapy. Nevertheless, the concept of aerobic glycolysis as the paradigm of tumor cell metabolism has been challenged, as some tumor cells exhibit high rates of oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial physiology in cancer cells is linked to the Warburg effect. Besides, its central role in apoptosis makes this organelle a promising "dual hit target" to selectively eliminate tumor cells. From a metabolic point of view, the fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and tumor cells share several features. In this paper we will review these common metabolic properties as well as the possible origins of the Crabtree and Warburg effects.},

Cancer cells display dramatically altered metabolic circuitry that appears to directly result from the oncogenic mutations selected during the tumorigenic process. An emerging theme in cancer biology is that many of the genes that can initiate tumorigenesis are intricately linked to metabolic regulation. In turn, it appears that a number of well-established tumor suppressors play critical roles in suppressing growth and/or proliferation when intracellular supplies of essential metabolites become reduced.

Principal Component Analysis of NMR data showed a clear classification between NAT and tumor tissues, however, LN-Met tissues were classified among tumor.

HNSCC and LN-Met tissues showed elevated levels of lactate, amino acids including leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, glycine, phenylalanine and tyrosine, choline containing compounds, creatine, taurine, glutathione, and decreased levels of triglycerides. These elevated metabolites were associated with highly active glycolysis, increased amino acids influx (anaplerosis) into the TCA cycle, altered energy metabolism, membrane choline phospholipid metabolism, and oxidative and osmotic defense mechanisms. Moreover, decreased levels of triglycerides may indicate lipolysis followed by $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids that may exist to deliver bioenergy for rapid tumor cell proliferation and growth.},

abstract = {Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are associated with multiple cellular functions such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. However, the direct roles of endogenous ROS production still remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that high levels of ROS were spontaneously produced by ovarian and prostate cancer cells. This elevated ROS production was inhibited by NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI) and mitochondria electron chain inhibitor rotenone in the cells. To further analyze the source of ROS production, we found that ovarian cancer cells have much higher expression of NOX4 NADPH oxidase, and that specific inhibition of NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox diminished ROS production. To analyze the functional relevance of ROS production, we showed that ROS regulated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in ovarian cancer cells. Elevated levels of endogenous ROS were required for inducing angiogenesis and tumor growth. NOX4 knockdown in ovarian cancer cells decreased the levels of VEGF and HIF-1$\alpha$ and tumor angiogenesis. This study suggests a new mechanism of higher ROS production in ovarian cancer cells and provides strong evidence that endogenous ROS play an important role for cancer cells to induce angiogenesis and tumor growth. This information may be useful to understand the new mechanism of cancer cells in inducing tumorigenesis and to develop new therapeutic strategy by targeting ROS signaling in human cancer in the future.

abstract = {Purpose: Although cetuximab, an anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, is an effective treatment for patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), its clinical use is limited by onset of resistance. Experimental Design: We characterized two colorectal cancer models to study the mechanisms of acquired resistance to cetuximab. Results: Following chronic treatment of nude mice bearing cetuximab-sensitive human GEO colon xenografts, cetuximab-resistant GEO (GEO-CR) cells were obtained. In GEO-CR cells, proliferation and survival signals were constitutively active despite EGFR inhibition by cetuximab treatment. Whole gene expression profiling identified a series of genes involved in the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-MET-dependent pathways, which were upregulated in GEO-CR cells. Furthermore, activated, phosphorylated MET was detected in GEO-CR cells. A second colorectal cancer cell line with acquired resistance to cetuximab was obtained (SW48-CR). Inhibition of MET expression by siRNA restored cetuximab sensitivity in GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells, whereas exogenous activation of MET by HGF stimulation in cetuximab-sensitive GEO and SW48 cells induced resistance to cetuximab. Treatment of GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells with PHA665752, a selective MET inhibitor, inhibited cell growth, proliferation, and survival signals and impaired cancer cell migration. Overexpression of TGF-, a specific EGFR ligand, was involved in the acquisition of cetuximab resistance in GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells. In fact, TGF- overexpression induced the EGFR-MET interaction, with subsequent MET phosphorylation and activation of MET downstream effectors in GEO-CR and SW48-CR cells. Conclusions: These results suggest that overexpression of TGF- through induction of EGFR-MET interaction contributes to cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer cells. The combined inhibition of EGFR and MET receptor could represent a strategy for preventing and/or overcoming cetuximab resistance in patients with colorectal cancer. Clin Cancer Res; 19(24); 6751-65.

abstract = {Membrane trafficking between organelles by vesiculotubular carriers is fundamental to the existence of eukaryotic cells. Central in ensuring that cargoes are delivered to their correct destinations are the Rab GTPases, a large family of small GTPases that control membrane identity and vesicle budding, uncoating, motility and fusion through the recruitment of effector proteins, such as sorting adaptors, tethering factors, kinases, phosphatases and motors. Crosstalk between multiple Rab GTPases through shared effectors, or through effectors that recruit selective Rab activators, ensures the spatiotemporal regulation of vesicle traffic. Functional impairments of Rab pathways are associated with diseases, such as immunodeficiencies, cancer and neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Glucocorticoids are widely used in the clinical setting as remedies for inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the constant increase in the number of patients suffering from glucocorticoid resistance could present a serious problem for clinicians. In these cases, it may be reasonable to use additional treatments to restore the therapeutic effect of glucocorticoids. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) and 18$\beta$-glycyrrhetinic acid (18$\beta$GA) are bioactive compounds in licorice that have been used for thousands of years in traditional Chinese medicine to treat coughs. We showed that GA and 18$\beta$GA exhibit potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. GA and 18$\beta$GA induced dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) expression, and this effect was unchanged by the addition of RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist. The stimulation of DUSP1 expression by GA and 18$\beta$GA occurred via both glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and PI3K signaling, and the simultaneous activation of transcription elements, such as AP1 (activator protein 1), CRE (cAMP response element), GRE (glucocorticoid receptor element) and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), was confirmed. Furthermore, we designed an in vitro glucocorticoid resistance model to verify the effects of GA and 18$\beta$GA on glucocorticoid resistance that was induced by ROS. The data showed that these two phytochemicals restored glucocorticoid sensitivity by depleting ROS through HO-1 expression. p38 and NO, which are factors that are induced by reactive oxygen species and caused depletion of GR signaling, were inhibited by GA and 18$\beta$GA treatment. This phenomenon was considered to be related to the coordinated modulation of GR and PI3K signaling by GA and 18$\beta$GA, in conjugation with AP1, CRE, GRE and NFAT activation. This study provides a possible strategy for enhancing the efficacy of glucocorticoids and may improve the prognosis of patients with serious inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {AIMS: We investigated the mechanism by which cannabinoid receptors-1 (CB1) and -2 (CB2) modulate inflammatory activities of macrophages. METHODS AND RESULTS: Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed the predominant CB2 expression in freshly isolated human monocytes. PMA, a potent inducer of differentiation, upregulated CB1 and increased CB1:CB2 transcript ratio from 1:17.5 to 1:3 in 5 days of culture. Immunohistochemistry showed that CB1 protein was colocalized in CD68- and CD36-positive macrophages in human atheroma. Through selective expression of CB1 or CB2 to thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal macrophages, we proved that CB1 and CB2 mediate opposing influences on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Flow cytometry showed that cannabinoid-induced ROS production by macrophages was CB1-dependent. Immunoblotting assays confirmed that macrophage CB1, not CB2, induced phosphorylation of p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase, which modulated ROS production and the subsequent synthesis of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. Pull-down assays showed that the Ras family small G protein, Rap1 was activated by CB2. Dominant-negative Rap1 profoundly enhanced CB1-dependent ROS production by macrophages, suggesting CB2 Rap1-dependently inhibits CB1-stimulated ROS production. CONCLUSION: CB1 promotes pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages through ROS production, which is negatively regulated by CB2 through Rap1 activation. Blocking CB1 together with selective activation of CB2 may suppress pro-inflammatory responses of macrophages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most challenging problems in biological image analysis is the quantification of the dynamical mechanism and complexity of the intracellular space. This paper investigates potential spatial chaos and complex behavior of the intracellular space of typical cancer and normal cell images whose structural details are revealed by the combination of scanning electron microscopy and focused ion beam systems. Such numerical quantifications have important implications for computer modeling and simulation of diseases.MethodsCancer cell lines derived from a human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-61) and normal mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells produced by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopes were used in this study. Spatial distributions of the organelles of cancer and normal cells can be analyzed at both short range and long range of the bounded dynamical system of the image space, depending on the orientations of the spatial cell. A procedure was designed for calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent, which is an indicator of the potential chaotic behavior in intracellular images. Furthermore, the sample entropy and regularity dimension were applied to measure the complexity of the intracellular images.

RESULTS: Positive values of the largest Lyapunov exponents (LLEs) of the intracellular space of the SCC-61 were obtained in different spatial orientations for both long-range and short-range models, suggesting the chaotic behavior of the cell. The MEF has smaller positive values of LLEs in the long range than those of the SCC-61, and zero vales of the LLEs in the short range analysis, suggesting a non-chaotic behavior. The intracellular space of the SCC-61 is found to be more complex than that of the MEF. The degree of complexity measured in the spatial distribution of the intracellular space in the diagonal direction was found to be approximately twice larger than the complexity measured in the horizontal and vertical directions.

CONCLUSION: Initial findings are promising for characterizing different types of cells and therefore useful for studying cancer cells in the spatial domain using state-of-the-art imaging technology. The measures of the chaotic behavior and complexity of the spatial cell will help computational biologists gain insights into identifying associations between the oscillation patterns and spatial parameters of cells, and appropriate model for simulating cancer cell signaling networks for cancer treatment and new drug discovery.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We aim to develop effective models for predicting postoperative distant metastasis for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) for the purpose of guiding tailored therapy.

METHODS: We used data from two centres to establish training (n=319) and validation (n=164) cohorts. All patients underwent curative surgical treatment. The clinicopathological features and 23 immunomarkers detected by immunohistochemistry were involved for variable selection. We constructed eight support vector machine (SVM)-based nomograms (SVM1-SVM4 and SVM1'-SVM4'). The nomogram constructed with the training cohort was tested further with the validation cohort.

RESULTS: The outcome of the SVM1 model in predicting postoperative distant metastasis was as follows: sensitivity, 44.7{\%}; specificity, 90.9{\%}; positive predictive value, 81.0{\%}; negative predictive value, 65.6{\%}; and overall accuracy, 69.5{\%}. The corresponding outcome of the SVM2 model was as follows: 44.7{\%}, 92.1{\%}, 82.9{\%}, 65.9{\%}, and 70.1{\%}, respectively. The corresponding outcome of the SVM3 model was as follows: 55.3{\%}, 93.2{\%}, 87.5{\%}, 70.7{\%}, and 75.6{\%}, respectively. The SVM4 model was the most effective nomogram in prediction, and the corresponding outcome was as follows: 56.6{\%}, 97.7{\%}, 95.6{\%}, 72.3{\%}, and 78.7{\%}, respectively.Similar results were observed in SVM1', SVM2', SVM3', and SVM4', respectively.

CONCLUSION: The SVM-based models integrating clinicopathological features and molecular markers as variables are helpful in selecting the patients of OSCC with high risk of postoperative distant metastasis.},

Here we explore the biological basis of this aggressive tumour, and identify two cell-cell adhesion genes as recurrently mutated in this malignancy. We first perform exome sequencing of four laryngeal carcinomas and their matched normal tissues. Among the 569 genes found to present somatic mutations, and based on their recurrence or functional relevance in cancer, we select 40 for further validation in 86 additional laryngeal carcinomas. We detect frequent mutations (14 of 90, 15{\%}) in CTNNA2 and CTNNA3-encoding $\alpha$-catenins. Functional studies reveal an increase in the migration and invasive ability of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells producing mutated forms of CTNNA2 and CTNNA3 or in cells where both $\alpha$-catenins are silenced. Analysis of the clinical relevance of these mutations demonstrates that they are associated with poor prognosis. We conclude that CTNNA2 and CTNNA3 are tumour suppressor genes frequently mutated in laryngeal carcinomas.},

abstract = {Glucose is the physiological stimulus for insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells. The uptake and phosphorylation of glucose initiate and control downstream pathways, resulting in insulin secretion. However, the temporal coordination of these events in beta cells is not fully understood. The recent development of the FLII(12)Pglu-700$\mu$-$\delta$6 glucose nanosensor facilitates real-time analysis of intracellular glucose within a broad concentration range. Using this fluorescence-based technique, we show the shift in intracellular glucose concentration upon external supply and removal in primary mouse beta cells with high resolution. Glucose influx, efflux, and metabolism rates were calculated from the time-dependent plots. Comparison of insulin-producing cells with different expression levels of glucose transporters and phosphorylating enzymes showed that a high glucose influx rate correlated with GLUT2 expression, but was largely also sustainable by high GLUT1 expression. In contrast, in cells not expressing the glucose sensor enzyme glucokinase glucose metabolism was slow. We found no evidence of oscillations of the intracellular glucose concentration in beta cells. Concomitant real-time analysis of glucose and calcium dynamics using FLII(12)Pglu-700$\mu$-$\delta$6 and fura-2-acetoxymethyl-ester determined a glucose threshold of 4mM for the [Ca(2+)](i) increase in beta cells. Indeed, a glucose concentration of 7mM had to be reached to evoke large amplitude [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. The K(ATP) channel closing agent glibenclamide was not able to induce large amplitude [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in the absence of glucose. Our findings suggest that glucose has to reach a threshold to evoke the [Ca(2+)](i) increase and subsequently initiate [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in a K(ATP) channel independent manner.},
