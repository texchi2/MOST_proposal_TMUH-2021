abstract = {As shown in our previous studies, growth and metastasis of ovarian cancer can be regulated by adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs). However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been revealed. In this study, a proteomics analysis was performed to compare protein expression treated with and without ADSCs in ovarian cancer cells. Protein levels were altered in ovarian cancer cells due to the treatment of ADSCs. Thymosin beta 4 X-linked (TMSB4X) levels changed dramatically, and this protein was identified as one of the most important candidate molecules contributing to the tumour-promoting effects of ADSCs. Compared with the cells that are cultured in the normal growth medium, the TMSB4X levels cultured in ADSC-conditioned medium increased significantly in ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, the growth and invasion of cancer cells were decreased, even in the ADSC-conditioned medium treatment group (P {\textless} 0.05), by the inhibition of TMSB4X. As shown in the bioluminescence images captured in vivo, increased ovarian cancer's growth and metastasis, along with elevated TMSB4X expression, were observed in the group of ADSC-conditioned medium, and the tumour-promoting effect of ADSCs was attenuated by the inhibition of TMSB4X. Based on our findings, increased TMSB4X expression may play a role in accelerating the ADSC-mediated proliferation, invasion, and migration of ovarian cancers.},

abstract = {We aimed to assess the risk of oral cancer incidence in a high-risk population, establish a predictive model for oral cancer among these high-risk individuals, and assess the predictive ability of the constructed model. Individuals aged ≥30 years who had a habit of smoking or betel nut chewing and had undergone oral cancer screening in 2010 or 2011 were selected as study subjects. The incidence of oral cancer among the subjects at the end of 2014 was determined. The annual oral cancer incidence among individuals with a positive screening result was 624 per 100,000 persons, which was 6.5 times that of the annual oral cancer incidence among all individuals screened. Male sex, aged 45-64 years, divorce, low educational level, presence of diabetes, presence of other cancers, high comorbidity severity, a habit of smoking or betel nut chewing, and low monthly salary were high-risk factors for oral cancer incidence (p {\textless} 0.05). The area under the curve of the predictive model for oral cancer incidence was 0.73, which indicated a good predictive ability. Therefore, the oral cancer screening policy for the high-risk population with a habit of smoking and/or betel nut chewing is beneficial for the early diagnosis of oral cancer.},

In this respect, CD56 (also known as neural cell adhesion molecule) is a very good example. CD56 is the archetypal phenotypic marker of natural killer cells but can actually be expressed by many more immune cells, including alpha beta T cells, gamma delta T cells, dendritic cells, and monocytes. Common to all these CD56-expressing cell types are strong immunostimulatory effector functions, including T helper 1 cytokine production and an efficient cytotoxic capacity. Interestingly, both numerical and functional deficiencies and phenotypic alterations of the CD56(+) immune cell fraction have been reported in patients with various infectious, autoimmune, or malignant diseases. In this review, we will discuss our current knowledge on the expression and function of CD56 in the hematopoietic system, both in health and disease.},

abstract = {Bladder cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors of the urinary system that seriously threatens the health of a population. In recent years, the application of immunotherapy has significantly changed the treatment of bladder cancer, but only some patients can benefit from the treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Many problems are unsolved in the field of bladder cancer immunotherapy, especially in the search for genes that are critical to the level of immune cell infiltration and new effective therapeutic targets. We attempted to use bioinformatics analysis to identify immune gene markers related to the prognosis of bladder cancer and to establish a prognostic signature for bladder cancer patients based on their immune gene expression profiles. We used univariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas bladder cancer cohort (TCGA-BLCA). Fifteen genes related to prognosis were screened using the survival analysis, correlation analysis, cancer and adjacent cancer differential expression analysis, and mutation analysis. The potential biological role of these genes was determined using survival analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assesses the prognostic value of the predictive signature. The gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG), Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and other methods were used to reveal the differential gene enrichment in the signaling pathways and cellular processes of high- and low-risk groups. The single-sample GSEA (ssGSEA) method was used to quantify the infiltration levels of 24 immune cells in the tumor immune microenvironment and these immune genes were found to be closely related to the tumor immune microenvironment. In summary, we screened 15 immune genes that were closely related to bladder cancer overall survival (OS) and may be potential prognostic indicators of bladder cancer. They may have research and clinical application value in bladder cancer immunotherapy. We used 15 immune genes to construct a new immune-related gene signature that was verified and could be helpful in improving individualized prognosis of patients with bladder cancer.},

abstract = {We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of 50 publications assessing the relationship between oral/oropharyngeal cancer and chewing betel quid, with (BQ+T) or without added tobacco (BQ-T), a common practice in many parts of Asia and globally among Asian immigrants. Exposure-response, by daily amount and years of BQ chewed, was assessed using spline models. Attributable fractions (PAF{\%}) were calculated to estimate the public health impact if BQ were no longer chewed. The meta-relative risk (mRR) for oral/oropharyngeal cancer in the Indian subcontinent was 2.56 (95{\%}CI, 2.00-3.28; 15 studies) for BQ-T and 7.74 (95{\%}CI, 5.38-11.13; 31 studies) for BQ+T; in Taiwan, China, the mRR for BQ-T was 10.98 (95{\%}CI, 4.86-24.84; 13 studies). Restricting to studies that adjusted for tobacco and alcohol use had only a small effect on the risk estimates. For BQ+T in the Indian subcontinent, the mRR was much higher in women (mRR, 14.56; 95{\%}CI, 7.63-27.76) than in men. Exposure-response analyses showed that the risk of oral/oropharyngeal cancer increased with increasing daily amount and duration (years) of chewing BQ in India and Taiwan, China. Roughly half of oral cancers in these countries could be prevented if BQ were no longer chewed (PAF{\%}=53.7{\%} for BQ-T in Taiwan, China; PAF{\%}=49.5{\%} for BQ+T in India). We demonstrate that betel quid chewing, with or without added tobacco, increases the risk of oral/oropharyngeal cancer in an exposure-dependent manner, independently of tobacco and alcohol use. Further work is needed to explain the higher risks associated with chewing BQ-T in Taiwan, China. What's new? Betel quid is commonly chewed in many parts of Asia and globally by migrants of Asian descent, making it a major risk factor for oral cancer in those populations. This study demonstrates that chewing betel quid, with or without added tobacco, increases the risk of oral and oropharyngeal cancer in a dose-response manner. The results summarize and quantify the impact of betel quid chewing on oral and oropharyngeal cancer by gender and subsite. This risk evaluation may aid public health prevention efforts, particularly on the Indian subcontinent and in Taiwan, China. {\textcopyright} 2013 UICC.},

abstract = {Among the most promising approaches to activating therapeutic antitumour immunity is the blockade of immune checkpoints. Immune checkpoints refer to a plethora of inhibitory pathways hardwired into the immune system that are crucial for maintaining self-tolerance and modulating the duration and amplitude of physiological immune responses in peripheral tissues in order to minimize collateral tissue damage. It is now clear that tumours co-opt certain immune-checkpoint pathways as a major mechanism of immune resistance, particularly against T cells that are specific for tumour antigens. Because many of the immune checkpoints are initiated by ligand-receptor interactions, they can be readily blocked by antibodies or modulated by recombinant forms of ligands or receptors. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) antibodies were the first of this class of immunotherapeutics to achieve US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. Preliminary clinical findings with blockers of additional immune-checkpoint proteins, such as programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1), indicate broad and diverse opportunities to enhance antitumour immunity with the potential to produce durable clinical responses.},

We have estimated the proportion of UADT cancer burden explained by tobacco and alcohol and how this varies with the incidence rates across Europe, cancer sub-site, gender and age. This should help estimate the minimum residual burden of other risk factors to UADT cancer, including human papillomavirus. We analysed 1981 UADT cancer cases and 1993 controls from the ARCAGE multicentre study. We estimated the population attributable risk (PAR) of tobacco alone, alcohol alone and their joint effect. Tobacco and alcohol together explained 73{\%} of UADT cancer burden of which nearly 29{\%} was explained by smoking alone, less than 1{\%} due to alcohol on its own and 44{\%} by the joint effect of tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco and alcohol together explained a larger proportion of hypopharyngeal/laryngeal cancer (PAR=85{\%}) than oropharyngeal (PAR=74{\%}), esophageal (PAR=67{\%}) and oral cancer (PAR=61{\%}). Tobacco and alcohol together explain only about half of the total UADT cancer burden among women. Geographically, tobacco and alcohol explained a larger proportion of UADT cancer in central (PAR=84{\%}) than southern (PAR=72{\%}) and western Europe (PAR=67{\%}). While the majority of the UADT cancers in Europe are due to tobacco or the joint effect of tobacco and alcohol, our results support a significant role for other risk factors in particular, for oral and oropharyngeal cancers and also for UADT cancers in southern and western Europe.},

We identify known and novel fitness genes and demonstrate that many previously identified OSCC-related cancer genes are non-essential and could have limited therapeutic value, while other fitness genes warrant further investigation for their potential as therapeutic targets. We validate a distinctive dependency on YAP1 and WWTR1 of the Hippo pathway, where the lost-of-fitness effect of one paralog can be compensated only in a subset of lines. We also discover that OSCCs with WWTR1 dependency signature are significantly associated with biomarkers of favourable response towards immunotherapy. In summary, we have delineated the genetic vulnerabilities of OSCC, enabling the prioritization of therapeutic targets for further exploration, including the targeting of YAP1 and WWTR1.},

abstract = {The metastasis of cancer is a complex and life-threatening process that is only  partially understood. Immune suppressive cells are recognized as important contributors to tumour progression and may also promote the development and growth of tumour metastases. Specifically, regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been found to promote primary tumour progression, and emerging pre-clinical data suggests that Tregs may promote metastasis and metastatic tumour growth. While the precise role that Tregs play in metastatic progression is understudied, recent findings have indicated that by suppressing innate and adaptive anti-tumour immunity, Tregs may shield tumour cells from immune detection, and thereby allow tumour cells to survive, proliferate and acquire characteristics that facilitate dissemination. This review will highlight our current understanding of Tregs in metastasis, including an overview of pre-clinical findings and discussion of clinical data regarding Tregs and therapeutic outcome. Evolving strategies to directly ablate Tregs or to inhibit their function will also be discussed. Improving our understanding of how Tregs may influence tumour metastasis may lead to novel treatments for metastatic cancer.},

abstract = {A high intratumoral frequency of neutrophils is associated with poor clinical outcome in most cancer entities. It is hypothesized that immunosuppressive MDSC (myeloid-derived suppressor cell) activity of neutrophils against tumor-reactive T cells contributes to this effect. However, direct evidence for such activity in situ is lacking. Here, we used whole-mount labeling and clearing, three-dimensional (3D) light sheet microscopy and digital image reconstruction supplemented by 2D multiparameter immunofluorescence, for in situ analyses of potential MDSC-T cell interactions in primary human head and neck cancer tissue. We could identify intratumoral hotspots of high polymorphonuclear (PMN)-MDSC and T cell colocalization. In these areas, the expression of effector molecules Granzyme B and Ki67 in T cells was strongly reduced, in particular for T cells that were in close proximity or physically engaged with PMN-MDSC, which expressed LOX-1 and arginase I. Patients with cancer with evidence for strong down-regulation of T cell function by PMN-MDSC had significantly impaired survival. In summary, our approach identifies areas of clinically relevant functional interaction between MDSC and T cells in human cancer tissue and may help to inform patient selection in future combination immunotherapies.},

To facilitate community-based investigation of the large-scale protein expression data generated by this platform, we have developed a user-friendly, open-access bioinformatic resource, The Cancer Proteome Atlas (TCPA, http://tcpaportal.org), which contains two separate web applications. The first one focuses on RPPA data of patient tumors, which contains {\textgreater}8,000 samples of 32 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other independent patient cohorts. The second application focuses on the RPPA data of cancer cell lines and contains {\textgreater}650 independent cell lines across 19 lineages. Many of these cell lines have publicly available, high-quality DNA, RNA, and drug screening data. TCPA provides various analytic and visualization modules to help cancer researchers explore these datasets and generate testable hypotheses in an effective and intuitive manner.

abstract = {Background: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) exists within a microenvironment rich in immune cells. Macrophages are particularly abundant in and around tumor tissue, and have been implicated in the growth, malignancy, and persistence of HNSCC (1). However, current literature reports variable degrees of association between the density of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and clinicopathologic markers of disease (2, 3). These inconsistent findings may be a result of differences in approach to TAM detection. Authors have measured total TAMs in tumor tissue, while others have stained tumor samples for individual subtypes of TAMs, which include pro-inflammatory (M1-like) and immunosuppressive (M2-like). Our aim is to more clearly define the prognostic significance of the phenotypes of tumor-associated macrophages in HNSCC. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of the existing publications investigating the relationship between TAMs (total and M2-like subtype) and T stage, nodal involvement, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, and tumor differentiation (Figure 1). A total of 12 studies were included. Forest plots and risk ratios were generated to report overall effect. Results: Higher density of both total and M2-like subtype of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment is associated with advanced T stage, increased rates of nodal positivity, presence of vascular invasion, and presence of lymphatic invasion (p {\textless} 0.0001; Figures 2–9). There is no significant association between TAM density, either total or M2-like subtype, and tumor differentiation (Figures 10, 11). Conclusions: Increased density of TAMs, including those of the M2-like phenotype, correlate with poor clinicopathologic markers in HNSCC. Our findings warrant additional investigation into the subpopulations of TAMs, the mechanisms behind their recruitment and differentiation, and the associated influence of each phenotype on tumor growth and invasion. A greater understanding of TAM dynamics in HNSCC is critical for directing further research and employing TAM-targeted adjunct therapies.},

abstract = {Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) represent a well curable malignity due to their exceptional response to cisplatin (CDDP). Despite remarkable treatment results, approximately 5{\%} of TGCT patients develop CDDP resistance and die. Exceptional curability makes TGCTs a highly valuable model system for studying the molecular mechanisms of CDDP sensitivity. Our study was aimed at revealing difference in gene expression between the CDDP-resistant and -sensitive TGCT cell lines, and hence at identifying candidate genes that could serve as potential biomarkers of CDDP response. Using gene expression array, we identified 281 genes that are differentially expressed in CDDP-resistant compared to -sensitive TGCT cell lines. The expression of 25 genes with the highest fold change was validated by RT-qPCR. Of them, DNMT3L, GAL, IGFBP2, IGFBP7, L1TD1, NANOG, NTF3, POU5F1, SOX2, WNT6, ZFP42, ID2, PCP4, SLC40A1 and TRIB3, displayed comparable expression change in gene expression array and RT-qPCR, when all CDDP-resistant TGCT cell lines were pairwise combined with all -sensitive ones. Products of the identified genes are pluripotency factors, or are involved in processes, such as cell metabolism, proliferation or migration. We propose that, after clinical validation, these genes could serve as prognostic biomarkers for early detection of CDDP response in TGCT patients.},

When observations are censored, the outcomes are only partially observed and standard deep learning algorithms cannot be directly applied. We develop a new class of deep learning algorithms for outcomes that are potentially censored. To account for censoring, the unobservable loss function used in the absence of censoring is replaced by a censoring unbiased transformation. The resulting class of algorithms can be used to estimate both survival probabilities and restricted mean survival. We show how the deep learning algorithms can be implemented by adapting software for uncensored data by using a form of response transformation. We provide comparisons of the proposed deep learning algorithms to existing risk prediction algorithms for predicting survival probabilities and restricted mean survival through both simulated datasets and analysis of data from breast cancer patients.},

abstract = {After a century of controversy, the notion that the immune system regulates cancer development is experiencing a new resurgence. An overwhelming amount of data from animal models--together with compelling data from human patients--indicate that a functional cancer immunosurveillance process indeed exists that acts as an extrinsic tumor suppressor. However, it has also become clear that the immune system can facilitate tumor progression, at least in part, by sculpting the immunogenic phenotype of tumors as they develop. The recognition that immunity plays a dual role in the complex interactions between tumors and the host prompted a refinement of the cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis into one termed "cancer immunoediting." In this review, we summarize the history of the cancer immunosurveillance controversy and discuss its resolution and evolution into the three Es of cancer immunoediting--elimination, equilibrium, and escape.},

To maximize the utility of TCPA, we have developed a new module called "TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis," which provides comprehensive protein-centric analyses that integrate protein expression data and other TCGA data across cancer types. We further demonstrate the value of this module by examining the correlations of RPPA proteins with significantly mutated genes, assessing the predictive power of somatic copy-number alterations, DNA methylation, and mRNA on protein expression, inferring the regulatory effects of miRNAs on protein expression, constructing a co-expression network of proteins and pathways, and identifying clinically relevant protein markers.

However, information regarding its applicability and effectiveness in a clinical prognostic factor setting remains unclear. Methods: The AI framework was derived from a pooled dataset of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) patients from three clinical centers (n = 1,421) by applying the TensorFlow deep learning algorithm to Cox-indicated pathologic (four), serologic (six), and etiologic (two) factors; this algorithm was validated using a dataset of ICC patients from an independent clinical center (n = 234). The model was compared to the commonly used staging system (American Joint Committee on Cancer; AJCC) and methodology (Cox regression) by evaluating the brier score (BS), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and area under curve (AUC) values. Results: The framework (BS, 0.17; AUC, 0.78) was found to be more accurate than the AJCC stage (BS, 0.48; AUC, 0.60; IDI, 0.29; NRI, 11.85; P {\textless} 0.001) and the Cox model (BS, 0.49; AUC, 0.70; IDI, 0.46; NRI, 46.11; P {\textless} 0.001).

abstract = {Thymosin $\beta$4 (T$\beta$4), a multifunctional 44-amino acid polypeptide and a member of  actin-binding proteins (ABPs), plays an important role in developmental processes and wound healing. In recent years an increasing number of data has been published suggesting T$\beta$4's involvement in tumorigenesis. However, T$\beta$4's role in melanoma tumor development still remains to be elucidated. In our study we demonstrate that T$\beta$4 is crucial for melanoma adhesion and invasion. For the purpose of our research we tested melanoma cell lines differing in invasive potential. Moreover, we applied shRNAs to silence TMSB4X (gene encoding T$\beta$4) expression in a cell line with high TMSB4X expression. We found out that T$\beta$4 is not only a component of focal adhesions (FAs) and interacts with several FAs components but also regulates FAs formation. We demonstrate that T$\beta$4 level has an impact on FAs' number and morphology. Moreover, manipulation with TMSB4X expression resulted in changes in cells' motility on non-coated and Matrigel(TM) (resembling basement membrane composition)-coated surfaces and drastically decreased invasion abilities of the cells. Additionally, a correlation between T$\beta$4 expression level and exhibition of mesenchymal-like [epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)] features was discovered. Cells with lowered TMSB4X expression were less EMT-progressed than control cells. Summarizing, obtained results show that T$\beta$4 by regulating melanoma cells' adhesion has an impact on motility features and EMT. Our study not only contributes to a better understanding of the processes underlying melanoma cells' capacity to create metastases but also highlights T$\beta$4 as a potential target for melanoma management therapy.},

abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) research in healthcare is accelerating rapidly, with potential applications being demonstrated across various domains of medicine. However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice. Main body: Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes. Conclusion: The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.},
annote = {to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions

Algorithmic interpretability is at an early stage but rapidly advancing
While AI approaches in medicine have yielded some impressive practical successes to date, their effectiveness is limited by their inability to ‘explain' their decision-making in an understandable way 

At present, a trade-off exists between performance and explainability. The best performing models (e.g. deep learning) are often the least explainable, whereas models with poorer performance (e.g. linear regression, decision trees) are the most explainable.

Explainable AI approaches are likely to facilitate faster adoption of AI systems into the clinical healthcare setting, and will help foster vital transparency and trust with their users.

所以第一線試用 IBM Watson for Oncology 已經失敗（不能只看結果）

survival analysis or biomarker discovery 則沒有那麼 critical need for Explainable AI.},

abstract = {The capacity of immunity to control and shape cancer, that is, cancer immunoediting, is the result of three processes that function either independently or in sequence: elimination (cancer immunosurveillance, in which immunity functions as an extrinsic tumour suppressor in naive hosts); equilibrium (expansion of transformed cells is held in check by immunity); and escape (tumour cell variants with dampened immunogenicity or the capacity to attenuate immune responses grow into clinically apparent cancers). Extensive experimental support now exists for the elimination and escape processes because immunodeficient mice develop more carcinogen-induced and spontaneous cancers than wild-type mice, and tumour cells from immunodeficient mice are more immunogenic than those from immunocompetent mice. In contrast, the equilibrium process was inferred largely from clinical observations, including reports of transplantation of undetected (occult) cancer from organ donor into immunosuppressed recipients. Herein we use a mouse model of primary chemical carcinogenesis and demonstrate that equilibrium occurs, is mechanistically distinguishable from elimination and escape, and that neoplastic cells in equilibrium are transformed but proliferate poorly in vivo. We also show that tumour cells in equilibrium are unedited but become edited when they spontaneously escape immune control and grow into clinically apparent tumours. These results reveal that, in addition to destroying tumour cells and sculpting tumour immunogenicity, the immune system of a naive mouse can also restrain cancer growth for extended time periods.},

But cancer cells avoid such immunosurveillance through the outgrowth of poorly immunogenic tumour-cell variants (immunoselection) and through subversion of the immune system (immunosubversion). At the early stages of carcinogenesis, cell-intrinsic barriers to tumour development seem to be associated with stimulation of an active antitumour immune response, whereas overt tumour development seems to correlate with changes in the immunogenic properties of tumour cells. The permanent success of treatments for cancer might depend on using immunogenic chemotherapy to re-establish antitumour immune responses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alcohol drinking is associated with high oral cancer (OC) risk. This  association is particularly evident in tobacco smoking/betel quid (BQ) chewing subjects. In a previous stratified meta-analysis (Petti S et al., Cancer Epidemiol 2012) we reported that drinking was inversely associated with OC in non-smoking BQ non-chewing individuals, while this association was reversed in smoking individuals. However, the previous study could be excessively influenced by a large primary study, which yielded more than 50{\%} of the weight of all the primary studies. Therefore, we updated this analysis using only recent studies. METHODS: Case-control studies published between 2010 and 2012 were searched. In each study, non-smoking/ BQ non-chewing exposed (ever routine drinkers) and unexposed (never drinkers) subjects with (cases)/without (controls) OC were extracted and odds ratio (OR) calculated. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed with Cochran's Q. Publication bias was formally assessed with trim and fill method. Sensitivity analysis to inclusion criteria was made. The pooled OR was assessed with the fixed- and random-effect methods and corrected for publication bias. RESULTS: Seven of these studies met the inclusion criteria: they were not heterogeneous enough. Correction for publication bias was not necessary and provided only one missing study. The OR estimates were 0.70 (95{\%} confidence interval -95CI, 0.51-0.98), 0.70 (95CI, 0.51-0.96), 0.75 (95CI, 0.54-1.03) with the three methods. Sensitivity analysis did not change the OR estimates considerably. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis corroborated the results of the previous analysis, confirming that drinking was inversely associated with OC in non-smoking, BQ non-chewing subjects.},

abstract = {Survival analysis (time-to-event analysis) is widely used in economics and finance, engineering, medicine and many other areas. A fundamental problem is to understand the relationship between the covariates and the (distribution of) survival times (times-to-event). Much of the previous work has approached the problem by viewing the survival time as the first hitting time of a stochastic process, assuming a specific form for the underlying stochastic process, using available data to learn the relationship between the covariates and the parameters of the model, and then deducing the relationship between covariates and the distribution of first hitting times (the risk). However, previous models rely on strong parametric assumptions that are often violated. This paper proposes a very different approach to survival analysis, DeepHit, that uses a deep neural network to learn the distribution of survival times directly. DeepHit makes no assumptions about the underlying stochastic process and allows for the possibility that the relationship between covariates and risk(s) changes over time. Most importantly, DeepHit smoothly handles competing risks; i.e. settings in which there is more than one possible event of interest. Comparisons with previous models on the basis of real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DeepHit achieves large and statistically significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {Given a predictive marker and a time-to-event response variable, the proportion of concordant pairs in a data set is called concordance index. A specifically useful marker is the risk predicted by a survival regression model. This article extends the existing methodology for applications where the length of the follow-up period depends on the predictor variables. A class of inverse probability of censoring weighted estimators is discussed in which the estimates rely on a working model for the conditional censoring distribution. The estimators are consistent for a truncated concordance index if the working model is correctly specified and if the probability of being uncensored at the truncation time is positive. In this framework, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and time trends in the discrimination ability of a model can be captured by varying the truncation time point. For illustration, we re-analyze a study on risk prediction for prostate cancer patients. The effects of misspecification of the censoring model are studied in simulated data.

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate whether there is evidence of field cancerization in patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) enrolled in a betel quid chewing area. We also assessed whether betel quid chewing is an independent risk factor for field cancerization in OSCC patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the records of 1570 OSCC patients who underwent radical tumor resection between 1996 and 2011. A total of 1243 study participants (79{\%}) had a positive history of betel quid chewing before surgery. Of the 767 patients treated with surgery alone, 599 (78{\%}) were preoperative chewers, whereas a history of preoperative betel quid chewing was identified in 644 (80{\%}) of the 803 patients who received adjuvant therapy. The 5-year control, survival, and second primary tumors (SPTs) rates served as the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Regardless of the treatment modality, more than 70{\%} of the SPTs were located in the oral cavity or soft palate. Despite a similar risk profile in terms of tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, and pathological margin status, preoperative chewers showed a significantly higher incidence of 5-year SPTs and local recurrences compared with non-chewers. Moreover, multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative betel quid chewing was an independent prognostic factor for 5-year local control and SPTs occurrence rates. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that preoperative betel quid chewers had a higher incidence of local recurrence and SPTs than non-chewers, suggesting that field cancerization may occur in OSCC patients with a history of betel quid chewing.},

Methods: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in the study from 2004 to 2008, of whom 13 received first-line cetuximab plus chemotherapy and 12 received second-line cetuximab with or without chemotherapy after the failure of cisplatin. Results: In the first-line chemotherapy group, the overall response [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] was 54{\%} and disease control rate [CR + PR + stable disease (SD)] was 62{\%}. In the cisplatin-failure therapy group, the overall response was 16.7{\%} and disease control rate was 50{\%}. Median overall survival (OS) and time to progression (TTP) in the first-line chemotherapy group were 857 days and 147 days, respectively. In the cisplatin-failure therapy group, median OS and TTP were 371 days and 136 days, respectively. The most common grade 3/4 toxicity in both groups of patients was infection/fever (23{\%} in the first-line group, 50{\%} in the cisplatin-failure group), followed by neutropenia (23{\%} in the first-line group, 25{\%} in the cisplatin-failure group).

abstract = {Numerous prognostic gene expression signatures for breast cancer were generated previously with few overlap and limited insight into the biology of the disease. Here we introduce a novel algorithm named SCoR (Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazard regression and Random resampling) to apply random resampling and clustering methods in identifying gene features correlated with time to event data. This is shown to reduce overfitting noises involved in microarray data analysis and discover functional gene sets linked to patient survival. SCoR independently identified a common poor prognostic signature composed of cell proliferation genes from six out of eight breast cancer datasets. Furthermore, a sequential SCoR analysis on highly proliferative breast cancers repeatedly identified T/B cell markers as favorable prognosis factors. In glioblastoma, SCoR identified a common good prognostic signature of chromosome 10 genes from two gene expression datasets (TCGA and REMBRANDT), recapitulating the fact that loss of one copy of chromosome 10 (which harbors the tumor suppressor PTEN) is linked to poor survival in glioblastoma patients. SCoR also identified prognostic genes on sex chromosomes in lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting patient gender might be used to predict outcome in this disease. These results demonstrate the power of SCoR to identify common and biologically meaningful prognostic gene expression signatures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Yao et al.},

abstract = {The occurrence of more than 200 diseases, including cancer, can be attributed to alcohol drinking. The global cancer deaths attributed to alcohol-consumption rose from 243,000 in 1990 to 337,400 in 2010. In 2010, cancer deaths due to alcohol consumption accounted for 4.2{\%} of all cancer deaths. Strong epidemiological evidence has established the causal role of alcohol in the development of various cancers, including esophageal cancer, head and neck cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer. The evidence for the association between alcohol and other cancers is inconclusive. Because of the high prevalence of ALDH2*2 allele among East Asian populations, East Asians may be more susceptible to the carcinogenic effect of alcohol, with most evidence coming from studies of esophageal cancer and head and neck cancer, while data for other cancers are more limited. The high prevalence of ALDH2*2 allele in East Asian populations may have important public health implications and may be utilized to reduce the occurrence of alcohol-related cancers among East Asians, including: 1) Identification of individuals at high risk of developing alcohol-related cancers by screening for ALDH2 polymorphism; 2) Incorporation of ALDH2 polymorphism screening into behavioral intervention program for promoting alcohol abstinence or reducing alcohol consumption; 3) Using ALDH2 polymorphism as a prognostic indicator for alcohol-related cancers; 4) Targeting ALDH2 for chemoprevention; and 5) Setting guidelines for alcohol consumption among ALDH2 deficient individuals. Future studies should evaluate whether these strategies are effective for preventing the occurrence of alcohol-related cancers.},

abstract = {Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the buccal mucosa is an aggressive oral cancer. It mainly occurs in Central and Southeast Asia, and is closely related to the practice of tobacco smoking and betel squid chewing. The high recurrence and low survival rates of buccal SCC require our continued efforts to understand the pathogenesis of the disease for designing better therapeutic strategies. We used proteomic technology to analyze buccal SCC tissues aiming at identifying tumor-associated proteins for the utilization as biomarkers or molecular targets. With the exception of alpha B-crystallin being substantially reduced, a number of proteins were found to be significantly over-expressed in cancer tissues. These increased proteins included glycolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, tumor antigens, cytoskeleton proteins, enzymes involved in detoxification and anti-oxidation systems, and proteins involved in mitochondrial and intracellular signaling pathways. These extensive protein variations indicate that multiple cellular pathways were involved in the process of tumorigenesis, and suggest that multiple protein molecules should be simultaneously targeted as an effective strategy to counter the disease. At least, SCC antigen, G protein, glutathione S-transferase, manganese superoxide dismutase, annexins, voltage-dependent anion channel, cyclophilin A, stratifin and galectin 7 are candidates for targeted proteins. The present findings also demonstrated that rich protein information can be produced by means of proteomic analysis for a better understanding of the oncogenesis and pathogenesis in a global way, which in turn is a basis for the rational designs of diagnostic and therapeutic methods.},

abstract = {In Taiwan, gastric cancer is ranked the sixth common cancer and the fifth cancer mortality. Surgical resection with radical lymph nodes dissection still plays an important role for gastric cancer. Our studies found that gastric cancer patients with SIRT3 expression have better prognosis than those without. SIRT3 expression is an independent better prognostic marker for overall survival. Besides, we also found that Caspase-3 expression in gastric cancer patients is related to favorable clinicopathological features and a positive prognosis after curative surgery. Furthermore, RhoA expression is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients, expecially diffuse type gastric cancer. SIRT3, Caspase-3 and RhoA may act as prognostic markers in human gastric cancer. With regard to signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells, we found that gastric cancer patients with positive c-Met expression had poorer overall survival than patients without c-Met expression (P = 0.043) and that Jagged1 expression significantly correlated with c-Met expression (r = 0.301; P = 0.004). In addition, Jagged1 activity increased after HGF stimulation, which in turn increased the downstream expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in a time dependent manner. After knockdown of receptor, HGF was found to increase the proliferation and migration ability in human gastric cancer cells. However, overexpression of N1IC still had no effect after HGF stimulation. Our study found a feedback loop between the HGF/c-Met and Jagged1/Notch1 signaling. Furthermore, both HGF/c-Met and Notch1 signaling triggered the COX-2 activity. In terms of histone modification, we found that gastric cancer patients with higher H3K4ac and H3K4me3 expression have favorable prognosis than those with lower expression. In vitro and in vivo study showed that gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and tumor growth were inhibited by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. H3K4ac expression is associated with better clinicopathological appearances and may act as a potential biomarkers in human gastric cancer. These results suggest that gastric cancer progression is not associated with a unique signaling pathway and that a feedback loop may exist between the HGF/c-Met and Notch1 signaling pathways, which may result in therapeutic resistance. Therefore, multi-modality therapies should be considered for treating gastric cancer. Besides, our studies found several predictive biomarkers for the prognosis of gastric cancer patients. We hope our studies could be helpful for the biological classification in the future.},

abstract = {Blockade of inhibitory receptors (IRs) overexpressed by T cells can activate antitumor immune responses, resulting in the most promising therapeutic approaches, particularly in bladder cancer, currently able to extend patient survival. Thanks to their ability to cross-present antigens to T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) are an immune cell population that plays a central role in the generation of effective antitumor T-cell responses. While IR function and expression have been investigated in T cells, very few data are available for DCs. Therefore, we analyzed whether DCs express IRs that can decrease their functions. To this end, we investigated several IRs (PD-1, CTLA-4, BTLA, TIM-3, and CD160) in circulating CD1c+ DCs, CD141+ DCs, and plasmacytoid DCs from healthy donors and patients with urothelial cancer (UCa). Different DC subsets expressed BTLA and TIM-3 but not other IRs. More importantly, BTLA and TIM-3 were significantly upregulated in DCs from blood of UCa patients. Locally, bladder tumor–infiltrating DCs also overexpressed BTLA and TIM-3 compared to DCs from paired nontumoral tissue. Finally, in vitro functional experiments showed that ligand-mediated engagement of BTLA and TIM-3 receptors significantly reduced the secretion of effector cytokines by DC subpopulations. Our findings demonstrate that UCa induces local and systemic overexpression of BTLA and TIM-3 by DCs that may result in their functional inhibition, highlighting these receptors as potential targets for UCa treatment. Patient summary We investigated the expression and function of a panel of inhibitory receptors in dendritic cells (DCs), an immune cell subpopulation critical in initiation of protective immune responses, among patients with urothelial carcinoma. We found high expression of BTLA and TIM-3 by blood and tumor DCs, which could potentially mediate decreased DC function. The results suggest that BTLA and TIM-3 might be new targets for urothelial carcinoma treatment.},

Co-inhibitory receptor ligands are highly expressed by a variety of malignancies allowing evasion of anti-tumour immunity. Recent studies demonstrate that manipulation of these co-inhibitory pathways can remove the immunological brakes that impede endogenous immune responses against tumours. Antibodies that block the interactions between co-inhibitory receptors and their ligands have delivered very promising clinical responses, as has been shown by recent successful trials targeting the CTLA-4 and PD-1 pathways. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of action and expression pattern of co-inhibitory receptors on different T cells subsets, emphasising differences between CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Based on landmark phase III trials, two anti-Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD-1) antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab have been approved for HNSCC by FDA and EMEA in the recurrent/metastatic setting; in addition, pembrolizumab has recently received FDA and EMEA approval as first line treatment. In clinical practice, only a minority of patients with HNSCC derive benefit from immunotherapy and the need for the discovery of novel biomarkers to optimize treatment strategies is becoming increasingly more relevant. Although currently only PD-L1 is widely used as a predictive biomarker for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in HNSCC, there are many ongoing trials focusing on the identification of new biomarkers. This review will summarize current data on emerging biomarkers for response to immunotherapy in HNSCC.},

Conclusions 
Immunotherapy is a complex and rapidly evolving field that has the potential to provide substantial clinical benefit to patients with a variety of cancers. However, it becomes increasingly clear that a sig- nificant proportion of patients do not respond to widely used im- munotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, only PD-L1 is a validated biomarker used in clinical practice to guide treatment selection. Research should focus on improvement of patient selection, by implementing PD-L1 and by identifying new predictive biomarkers. In this context, tumor mutational burden, INF-$\gamma$ signature, HPV status and the host's microbiome have emerged as potential pre- dictors of immune response and are currently being evaluated in clin- ical trials. In addition, the tumor microenvironment represents an in- teresting source for the development of novel biomarkers. On the other hand, combination therapies will be required to increase treatment efficacy. Investigating cancer immunology by reverse translating to the laboratory from clinical studies is needed to bring benefit to a greater number of patients. Development of strategies for patients who lack preexisting immunity is also necessary. Such strategies will be able to fulfill the promise that immunotherapy brings to the advancement of oncology. Indeed, we are at the beginning of an exciting journey for patients and for scientific investigation.},

@article{Knowles2018,
abstract = {Melanoma, although the least common form of skin cancer, causes 80{\%} of associated deaths due to its metastatic properties. It is highly refractory to treatment, and there is therefore a great need for more effective therapeutic options. Previous work in our lab has shown that CD24 expression can discriminate a highly aggressive and drug-resistant subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) from within those cells that have undergone epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in epithelial tumours. Melanomas are a nonepithelial tumour type arising in a lineage that has undergone a developmental EMT, and we therefore hypothesized that CD24 may also discriminate a treatment-resistant CSC subpopulation in melanoma. Cell-line work enabled us to identify a novel CSC subpopulation in melanoma expressing CD24 alongside the established melanoma stem cell marker CD271, and demonstrated its resistance to current therapies including BRAF inhibitors. We now want to establish whether such a subpopulation exists in melanoma tumour specimens. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a novel population coexpressing CD24 and CD271 exists in patient melanoma specimens and whether their presence correlates with clinical characteristics and poor prognosis in patients. We have built a new coimmunofluorescent staining protocol for measurement of CD24 and CD271 staining on a single-cell basis using the InCell 6000 automated confocal screening microscope, enabling us to screen whole-tumour sections and quantify staining on a single-cell basis. We present here data showing precise quantification of CD24 and CD272 costaining using this protocol. We will next stain primary and metastatic tumour specimens, localizing staining within the specimens and correlating the size and location of the CSC subpopulation with clinical characteristics and patient outcome. This novel treatment-resistant CSC subpopulation may present an important cellular target for new melanoma therapeutics that can help prevent the rapid recurrence currently seen after therapy.},

RESULTS: Up to now, observations of neoplastic soft tissue lesions in mummified remains are limited to 15 cases, and only 4 of them present malignancies; 14 cases of calcified benign tumors, including 13 neoplasms of the female reproductive system and 1 teratoma, are also documented. CONCLUSIONS: The main reasons for the rarity of soft tissue tumors in palaeopathology, especially of malignancies, are apparently the short life span of past populations, the scarcity of mummified remains available in comparison with skeletal remains, and technical difficulties in the detection of neoplastic lesions in mummified tissues.},

abstract = {Background: Pembrolizumab is active in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression associated with improved response. Methods: KEYNOTE-048 was a randomised, phase 3 study of participants with untreated locally incurable recurrent or metastatic HNSCC done at 200 sites in 37 countries. Participants were stratified by PD-L1 expression, p16 status, and performance status and randomly allocated (1:1:1) to pembrolizumab alone, pembrolizumab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (pembrolizumab with chemotherapy), or cetuximab plus a platinum and 5-fluorouracil (cetuximab with chemotherapy). Investigators and participants were aware of treatment assignment. Investigators, participants, and representatives of the sponsor were masked to the PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) results; PD-L1 positivity was not required for study entry. The primary endpoints were overall survival (time from randomisation to death from any cause) and progression-free survival (time from randomisation to radiographically confirmed disease progression or death from any cause, whichever came first) in the intention-to-treat population (all participants randomly allocated to a treatment group). There were 14 primary hypotheses: superiority of pembrolizumab alone and of pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with chemotherapy for overall survival and progression-free survival in the PD-L1 CPS of 20 or more, CPS of 1 or more, and total populations and non-inferiority (non-inferiority margin: 1{\textperiodcentered}2) of pembrolizumab alone and pembrolizumab with chemotherapy versus cetuximab with chemotherapy for overall survival in the total population. The definitive findings for each hypothesis were obtained when statistical testing was completed for that hypothesis; this occurred at the second interim analysis for 11 hypotheses and at final analysis for three hypotheses. Safety was assessed in the as-treated population (all participants who received at least one dose of allocated treatment). This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02358031. Findings: Between April 20, 2015, and Jan 17, 2017, 882 participants were allocated to receive pembrolizumab alone (n=301), pembrolizumab with chemotherapy (n=281), or cetuximab with chemotherapy (n=300); of these, 754 (85{\%}) had CPS of 1 or more and 381 (43{\%}) had CPS of 20 or more. At the second interim analysis, pembrolizumab alone improved overall survival versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the CPS of 20 or more population (median 14{\textperiodcentered}9 months vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, hazard ratio [HR] 0{\textperiodcentered}61 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}83], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0007) and CPS of 1 or more population (12{\textperiodcentered}3 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}3, 0{\textperiodcentered}78 [0{\textperiodcentered}64–0{\textperiodcentered}96], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0086) and was non-inferior in the total population (11{\textperiodcentered}6 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7, 0{\textperiodcentered}85 [0{\textperiodcentered}71–1{\textperiodcentered}03]). Pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved overall survival versus cetuximab with chemotherapy in the total population (13{\textperiodcentered}0 months vs 10{\textperiodcentered}7 months, HR 0{\textperiodcentered}77 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}63–0{\textperiodcentered}93], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0034) at the second interim analysis and in the CPS of 20 or more population (14{\textperiodcentered}7 vs 11{\textperiodcentered}0, 0{\textperiodcentered}60 [0{\textperiodcentered}45–0{\textperiodcentered}82], p=0{\textperiodcentered}0004) and CPS of 1 or more population (13{\textperiodcentered}6 vs 10{\textperiodcentered}4, 0{\textperiodcentered}65 [0{\textperiodcentered}53–0{\textperiodcentered}80], p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}0001) at final analysis. Neither pembrolizumab alone nor pembrolizumab with chemotherapy improved progression-free survival at the second interim analysis. At final analysis, grade 3 or worse all-cause adverse events occurred in 164 (55{\%}) of 300 treated participants in the pembrolizumab alone group, 235 (85{\%}) of 276 in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and 239 (83{\%}) of 287 in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group. Adverse events led to death in 25 (8{\%}) participants in the pembrolizumab alone group, 32 (12{\%}) in the pembrolizumab with chemotherapy group, and 28 (10{\%}) in the cetuximab with chemotherapy group. Interpretation: Based on the observed efficacy and safety, pembrolizumab plus platinum and 5-fluorouracil is an appropriate first-line treatment for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and pembrolizumab monotherapy is an appropriate first-line treatment for PD-L1-positive recurrent or metastatic HNSCC.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cashiers are not the only workers in the Retail Sector (RS) who are exposed to biomechanical overload risk of the upper limbs and spine.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among employees in the RS.
METHODS: 3380 Italian workers were asked to complete a standardized medical history questionnaire to collect data on symptoms and diagnosed disorders affecting upper limbs, spine and knees. These were then compared with data on subjects not exposed to biomechanical overload risk.
RESULTS: 21.1{\%} of the workers reported at least one disorder affecting the upper limbs (OR 5.05), i.e., shoulder (OR 3.39), elbow (OR 4.25), wrist/hand (OR 8.39) and CTS (OR 8.70). The prevalence of disc hernia was 16{\%} (OR 3.82). A high prevalence of knee complaints was also found among subjects employed in the RS (OR 1.73).
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders seems to confirm the presence of a risk of biomechanical overload for most job positions in the retail sector, although a possible selection bias cannot be completely ignored. Recommendations for future studies aiming to confirm our results include: involving all workers in every store and collecting information about diagnostic procedures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a unique and major health concern worldwide. Significant increases in glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis have been observed in HNSCC cells. Glucose transporters (GLUTs) represent a major hub in the glycolysis pathway, with GLUT4 having the highest glucose affinity. However, GLUT4's role in HNSCC has not been fully appreciated. METHODS: An in silico analysis was performed in HNSCC cohorts to identify the most significant glucose transporter associated with HNSCC patient prognosis. An immunohistochemical analysis of a tissue microarray with samples from 90 HNSCC patients was used to determine the association of GLUT4 with prognosis. Complementary functional expression and knockdown studies of GLUT4 were performed to investigate whether GLUT4 plays a role in HNSCC cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. The detailed molecular mechanism of the function of GLUT4 in inducing HNSCC cell metastasis was determined. RESULTS: Our clinicopathologic analysis showed that increased GLUT4 expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma patients was significantly associated with a poor overall survival (OS, P = 0.035) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.001). Furthermore, the ectopic overexpression of GLUT4 in cell lines with low endogenous GLUT4 expression resulted in a significant increase in migratory ability both in vitro and in vivo, whereas the reverse phenotype was observed in GLUT4-silenced cells. Utilizing a GLUT4 overexpression model, we performed gene expression microarray and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to determine that the transcription factor tripartite motif-containing 24 (TRIM24) was the main downstream regulator of GLUT4. In addition, DDX58 was confirmed to be the downstream target of TRIM24, whose downregulation is essential for the migratory phenotype induced by GLUT4-TRIM24 activation in HNSCC cells. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we identified altered glucose metabolism in the progression of HNSCC and showed that it could be partially attributed to the novel link between GLUT4 and TRIM24. This novel signaling axis may be used for the prognosis and therapeutic treatment of HNSCC in the future.},

abstract = {The cancer immunosurveillance hypothesis postulates that the immune system can recognize cancer cell precursors and destroy those cells before a clinical manifestation occurs. During the last decades several groups have presented evidence of the influence and role of immune activation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients; however, much less is known about the role of immune activation in potentially malignant oral disorders (PMOD). OSCC may be preceded by a PMOD. Two of the most common PMODs in the Western population are oral leukoplakia (LPL), defined as a predominantly white patch in the oral mucosa that cannot be characterized as any other definable lesion, and oral lichen planus (OLP) defined as a chronic inflammation in the oral mucosa manifested as bilateral white hyperkeratotic striations with or without erythema, ulceration, bullae or plaque. The general aim of this thesis was to characterize the immune response in PMODs and oral cancer and to relate immune response to malignant transformation. Another aim was to address whether long-term immunosuppression in a large cohort of solid organ transplant (SOT) patients predisposes for cancer in the oral cavity and lip. In papers I–III clinical data and biopsy specimens were analysed from patients with OLP and healthy oral mucosa (I), patients with LPL with and without dysplasia and OSCC (II) and those with LPL with dysplasia with (LPL-ca) or without (LPL-dys) malignant transformation (III). Immunohistochemistry was used to detect different cell types of interest, in particular, subtypes of dendritic Langerhans cells (LCs) and T cells. In paper IV a cohort of SOT patients were correlated with the Swedish Cancer Register for prevalence of oral and lip cancer and compared with the prevalence in the Swedish population. Overall 5-year survival in SOT patients with oral and lip cancer was compared to an age- and gender-matched control group with oral and lip cancer without previous SOT. In paper I the results showed that OLP patients had a significantly higher number of dendritic Langerhans cells (LCs) in the epithelium and the connective tissue than in healthy control patients. Also, cells with dendritic morphology and expressing the maturation marker CD83 were found in clusters with lymphocytes in the connective tissue. In paper II the results showed that both cytotoxic T cells and dendritic Langerhans cells were significantly increased in connective tissue in LPL with dysplasia compared to LPL without dysplasia, indicating an immune response to cells with cell dysplasia. In OSCC, the influx of T cells and LCs was increased almost a thousand-fold compared to LPL. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed a co-localization of LCs and T cells in LPL with dysplasia and OSCC, indicating possible immune activation In paper III quantitative analyses showed that patients with LPL displaying cell dysplasia that transformed into OSCC had lower numbers of T cells than a group of patients with LPL with dysplasia that did not transform into OSCC during the observation period. In paper IV the results showed a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) that was increased for both oral (SIR: 6.3) and lip cancer (SIR: 43.7) in SOT patients compared to non-SOT patients. Also, the overall 5-year survival was decreased for lip cancer in SOT patients compared to non-SOT lip cancer patients. To conclude the findings in papers I, II and III, evidence of immunosurveillance in PMOD and OSCC are presented. After long-standing immunosuppression in patients with SOT there is an increased risk for both lip and oral cancer, and the overall survival for patients with lip cancer is also negatively affected. The concept of immunosurveillance originally proposed by Dunn et al. in 2004 is well in line with the findings in this thesis of PMOD and oral cancer.},

abstract = {Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer with a 5-year survival rate {\textless}7{\%} and is ultimately refractory to most treatments. To date, an assessment of immunologic factors relevant to disease has not been comprehensively performed for treatment-na{\"{i}}ve patients. We hypothesized that systemic immunologic biomarkers could predict overall survival (OS) in treatment-na{\"{i}}ve PDAC patients. Experimental Design: Peripheral blood was collected from 73 patients presenting with previously untreated metastatic PDAC. Extensive immunologic profiling was conducted to assess relationships between OS and the level of soluble plasma biomarkers or detailed immune cell phenotypes as measured by flow cytometry. Results: Higher baseline levels of the immunosuppressive cytokines IL6 and IL10 were strongly associated with poorer OS (P = 0.008 and 0.026, respectively; HR = 1.16 and 1.28, respectively), whereas higher levels of the monocyte chemoattractant MCP-1 were associated with significantly longer OS (P = 0.045; HR = 0.69). Patients with a greater proportion of antigen-experienced T cells (CD45RO+ )hadlongerOS(CD4 P = 0.032; CD8 P = 0.036; HR = 0.36 and 0.61, respectively). Although greater expression of the T-cell checkpoint molecule CTLA-4 on CD8+ T cells was associated with significantly shorter OS (P = 0.020; HR = 1.53), the TIM3 molecule had a positive association with survival when expressed on CD4+ T cells (P = 0.046; HR = 0.62). Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that baseline immune status predicts PDAC disease course and overall patient survival. To our knowledge, this work represents the largest cohort and most comprehensive immune profiling of treatment-na{\"{i}}ve metastatic PDAC patients to date.},

Survival prediction using DeepSurv, a deep learning based-survival prediction algorithm, was compared with random survival forest (RSF) and the Cox proportional hazard model (CPH). DeepSurv showed the best performance among the three models, the c-index of the training and testing sets reaching 0.810 and 0.781, respectively, followed by RSF (0.770/0.764), and CPH (0.756/0.694).

Results: Nivolumab showed a significant overall survival benefit in platinum-refractory HNSCC patients. For platinum-sensitive or first-line patients, pembrolizumab monotherapy (patients with PD-L1 Combined Positive Score ≥ 20) or pembrolizumab-platinum-fluorouracil improved overall survival vs the EXTREME (cetuximab-platinum-fluorouracil).

Here, we identified a major role for the globular (G)-actin-binding protein thymosin-$\beta$4 (TMSB4X) in PCP establishment and cell adhesion in the developing epidermis. Depletion of Tmsb4x in mouse embryos hindered eyelid closure and hair-follicle angling owing to PCP defects. Tmsb4x depletion did not preclude epidermal cell adhesion in vivo or in vitro; however, it resulted in abnormal structural organization and stability of adherens junction (AJ) due to defects in filamentous (F)-actin and G-actin distribution. In cultured keratinocytes, TMSB4X depletion increased the perijunctional G/F-actin ratio and decreased G-actin incorporation into junctional actin networks, but it did not change the overall actin expression level or cellular F-actin content. A pharmacological treatment that increased the G/F-actin ratio and decreased actin polymerization mimicked the effects of Tmsb4x depletion on both AJs and PCP. Our results provide insights into the regulation of the actin pool and its involvement in AJ function and PCP establishment.},

mexchy1000 created DeepSurv{\_}Keras. However, it is a very raw prototype: it is not properly documented nor validated. Moreover, it is not being actively supported anymore. Therefore, I used it as a rough starting point for the development of DeepSurvK.

abstract = {Tumor cell populations have been recently proposed to be composed of two compartments: tumor-initiating cells characterized by a slow and asymmetrical growth, and the "differentiated" cancer cells with a fast and symmetrical growth. Cancer stem cells or cancer-initiating cells (CICs) play a crucial role in tumor recurrence. The resistance of CICs to drugs and irradiation often allows them to survive traditional therapy. NK cells are potent cytotoxic lymphocytes that can recognize tumor cells. In this study, we have analyzed the NK cell recognition of tumor target cells derived from the two cancer cell compartments of colon adenocarcinoma lesions. Our data demonstrate that freshly purified allogeneic NK cells can recognize and kill colorectal carcinoma-derived CICs whereas the non-CIC counterpart of the tumors (differentiated tumor cells), either autologous or allogeneic, is less susceptible to NK cells. This difference in the NK cell susceptibility correlates with higher expression on CICs of ligands for NKp30 and NKp44 in the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) group of activating NK receptors. In contrast, CICs express lower levels of MHC class I, known to inhibit NK recognition, on their surface than do the "differentiated" tumor cells. These data have been validated by confocal microscopy where NCR ligands and MHC class I molecule membrane distribution have been analyzed. Moreover, NK cell receptor blockade in cytotoxicity assays demonstrates that NCRs play a major role in the recognition of CIC targets. This study strengthens the idea that biology-based therapy harnessing NK cells could be an attractive opportunity in solid tumors.},

abstract = {Lymphocytes were originally thought to form the basis of a ‘cancer immunosurveillance' process that protects immunocompetent hosts against primary tumour development1,2, but this idea was largely abandoned when no differences in primary tumour development were found between athymic nude mice and syngeneic wild-type mice3,4,5. However, subsequent observations that nude mice do not completely lack functional T cells6,7 and that two components of the immune system—IFN$\gamma$8,9 and perforin10,11,12—help to prevent tumour formation in mice have led to renewed interest in a tumour-suppressor role for the immune response. Here we show that lymphocytes and IFN$\gamma$ collaborate to protect against development of carcinogen-induced sarcomas and spontaneous epithelial carcinomas and also to select for tumour cells with reduced immunogenicity. The immune response thus functions as an effective extrinsic tumour-suppressor system. However, this process also leads to the immunoselection of tumour cells that are more capable of surviving in an immunocompetent host, which explains the apparent paradox of tumour formation in immunologically intact individuals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a major cause of cancer death worldwide, which is mainly due to recurrence leading to treatment failure and patient death. Histological status of surgical margins is a currently available assessment for recurrence risk in OSCC; however histological status does not predict recurrence, even in patients with histologically negative margins. Therefore, molecular analysis of histologically normal resection margins and the corresponding OSCC may aid in identifying a gene signature predictive of recurrence. METHODS: We used a meta-analysis of 199 samples (OSCCs and normal oral tissues) from five public microarray datasets, in addition to our microarray analysis of 96 OSCCs and histologically normal margins from 24 patients, to train a gene signature for recurrence. Validation was performed by quantitative real-time PCR using 136 samples from an independent cohort of 30 patients. RESULTS: We identified 138 significantly over-expressed genes ({\textgreater} 2-fold, false discovery rate of 0.01) in OSCC. By penalized likelihood Cox regression, we identified a 4-gene signature with prognostic value for recurrence in our training set. This signature comprised the invasion-related genes MMP1, COL4A1, P4HA2, and THBS2. Over-expression of this 4-gene signature in histologically normal margins was associated with recurrence in our training cohort (p = 0.0003, logrank test) and in our independent validation cohort (p = 0.04, HR = 6.8, logrank test). CONCLUSION: Gene expression alterations occur in histologically normal margins in OSCC. Over-expression of the 4-gene signature in histologically normal surgical margins was validated and highly predictive of recurrence in an independent patient cohort. Our findings may be applied to develop a molecular test, which would be clinically useful to help predict which patients are at a higher risk of local recurrence.},

abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade treatments bring remarkable clinical benefits to fighting several solid malignancies. However, the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in breast cancer remains controversial. Several clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockades focused on the effect of CTLA4 and PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors on breast cancer. Only a small portion of patients benefited from these therapies. Here we systematically investigated the expression of 50 immune checkpoint genes, including ADORA2A, LAG-3, TIM-3, PD1, PDL1, PDL2, CTLA-4, IDO1, B7-H3, B7-H4, CD244, BTLA, TIGIT, CD80, CD86, VISTA, CD28, ICOS, ICOSLG, HVEM, CD160, LIGHT, CD137, CD137L, OX40, CD70, CD27, CD40, CD40LG, LGALS9, GITRL, CEACAM1, CD47, SIRPA, DNAM1, CD155, 2B4, CD48, TMIGD2, HHLA2, BTN2A1, DC-SIGN, BTN2A2, BTN3A1, BTNL3, BTNL9, CD96, TDO, CD200 and CD200R, in different subtypes of breast cancer and assessed their prognostic value. The results showed that the expression patterns of these 50 immune checkpoint genes were distinct in breast cancer. High expression of B7-H3 mRNA was significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS), especially in patients with luminal A and luminal B breast cancer. The mRNA expression levels of TIM-3, ADORA2A, LAG3, CD86, CD80, PD1 and IDO1 had no relationship with OS in breast cancer. High expression levels of CTLA-4 and TIGIT were correlated with favorable prognosis in breast cancer. Interestingly, we observed that B7-H3 expression was negatively correlated with the efficacy of cyclophosphamide (CTX). In summary, our study suggested that B7-H3 has potential prognostic value in breast cancer and is a promising target for immune therapy.},

We examined the mRNA expression level of candidate immune checkpoint genes between breast cancer and normal tissue based on data from the UALCAN database (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu/). A heat map was made to compare the expression differences in these two groups. The relationship between immune checkpoint mRNA expression and prognosis in breast cancer was analyzed with the KM-plotter database (http://www.kmplot.com//). Moreover, the CellMiner60 website was used to assess the association between immune checkpoint mRNA expression and the efficiency of several clinic drugs, which were widely used for breast cancer (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/).

abstract = {Background: The survival analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In order to utilize a continuous gene expression for survival analysis, it is necessary to determine a cutoff point by the dichotomization of the patients. There is some optimization software for cutoff determination. However, those predetermined cutoffs by software usually set at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) value to find a significant P-value of the Kaplan-Meier curve. There are few clinicopathological features available on their pre-processed data sets. Methods: We developed a comprehensive workflow by R script, running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling, and biomarker discovery. Results: Using this workflow on the TCGA HNSCC cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500) programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders, we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient survival. According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni adjusted P-value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard ratio ({\&}gt;=1.5), there were ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, which are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of overall survival (OS). At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients (with hazard ratio {\&}lt;=0.5), named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB. Further validations are warranted.Conclusions: We suggested this analysis tool equipped with an optimal cutoff finder will help with biomarker discovery of protein-coding genes, in terms of tumor-agnostic therapy.},

Worldwide, OSCC is the eighth most common human cancer, with more than 500,000 new cases being diagnosed every year with a fairly onerous prognosis, encouraging further research on factors that might modify disease outcome. Genetic and/or environmental risk factors associated with the development of oral cancer have been sufficiently understood (smoking, alcohol, betel, diet, living habits, etc.). Knowledge of the genetic basis in oral carcinogenesis is still a challenging task. To improve the diagnosis and prevention, a previously unknown type of chromatin modification, known as epigenetic, which is defined as heritable DNA changes that are not encoded in the sequence itself and which are reversible and increasingly appear to serve fundamental roles in cell differentiation and development are studied. Tumors shed their DNA into the blood and epigenetic changes that occur early during tumorigenesis, sometimes even in premalignant lesions, can provide valuable biomarkers. Key components involved in epigenetic regulation are DNA methylation, histone modifications and modifications in micro ribonucleic acids (miRNAs). Epigenetic modifications may contribute to aberrant epigenetic mechanisms seen in oral precancers and cancers. In the near future, epigenetic variations found in oral dysplastic cells can act as a molecular fingerprint for malignancies.},

abstract = {Background MEDI1873 is a novel GITR-ligand/IgG1 agonist fusion protein that binds to the co-stimulatory molecule GITR, which is upregulated on activated T cells. This Phase 1 study (NCT02583165) evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary antitumor activity in patients with advanced solid tumors. Methods MEDI1873 was administered IV Q2W in sequential dose escalation (DE) cohorts: 2 single patient cohorts (1.5 and 3 mg), followed by six 3+3 DE cohorts (7.5, 25, 75, 250, 500 and 750 mg). Antitumor response was assessed using RECIST v 1.1. Pharmacodynamic cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) or colorectal cancer receiving 75 or 250 mg were evaluated for intratumoral CD8, FOXP3, GITR and tumoral PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry using matched biopsies from pretreatment and day 29. Peripheral blood from all patients was monitored for type-2 IFN cytokine levels, gene expression, and lymphocyte phenotype by flow cytometry up to day 43. Results As of 1 March 2018, 40 patients have been dosed in the DE (28) and pharmacodynamic (12) cohorts. MEDI1873 elimination half-life was {\~{}}2.0 days. MEDI1873 pharmacokinetics was dose-proportional over a range of 1.5 to 500 mg. Antidrug antibodies were rare and had minimal impact on pharmacokinetics. MEDI1873 engaged GITR as evidenced by {\textgreater}50{\%} reductions in peripheral GITR-expressing memory CD4+ T cells using a competitive target engagement assay. The duration of GITR+ T-cell suppression correlated with MEDI1873 dose. At doses ≥75 mg, peripheral IFN$\gamma$, IP-10, I-TAC and MIG were elevated on days 2 and 3. This was followed by increased Ki67+CD4+ T cells on day 15. Additionally, patients with high baseline GITR levels (≥ median) had a sustained elevation of Ki67+CD4+ T cells to Day 43. Of 8 patients with evaluable paired tumor biopsies, one patient with HPV+ HNSCC and the highest baseline GITR on CD4+ T cells showed a 2x increase in intratumoral CD8+ and tumoral PD-L1+ cells. Intratumorally, MEDI1873 induced a ≥25{\%} reduction in GITR+/FOXP3+ T cells in 5 of 5 evaluable patients. Patients with prolonged stable disease (≥40 weeks) had an average 2x elevation in Ki67+CD4+ peripheral T cells compared to all other patients. Conclusions MEDI1873 engages GITR on circulating blood cells resulting in increased peripheral IFN$\gamma$ production and CD4+memory T-cell proliferation coupled with a decrease in intratumoral GITR+/FOXP3+ cells. These pharmacodynamic effects are consistent with the compound's mechanism of action and may be enhanced in patients with high baseline GITR expression.},

abstract = {Oral cancer is the sixth most frequent cancer in the world. Buccal mucosa originated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most aggressive oral cancers. It mainly occurs in Taiwan, Central and Southeast Asia, and is closely related to the practice of tobacco smoking and betel squid chewing. The high recurrence and low survival rates of buccal SCC remained an important focus for us to understand the pathogenesis of the disease in order to design better therapeutic strategies. Here we applied novel proteomic technology to analyze oral cancer cell lines and paired N/T buccal SCC tissues to identify tumor-associated proteins as new oral cancer biomarkers or molecular targets. We further evaluated a novel cancer therapeutical compound deguelin global protein response in oral cancer cell line SAS. Our result showed a number of proteins were found to be significantly over-expressed or down-regulated in oral cancer cell lines and clinical samples. These increased proteins included glycolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, tumor antigens, cytoskeleton proteins, enzymes involved in detoxification and anti-oxidation systems, and proteins involved in mitochondrial and intracellular signaling pathways. These extensive protein variations indicate that multiple cellular pathways were involved in the process of tumorigenesis, and suggest that multiple protein molecules should be simultaneously targeted as an effective strategy to counter the disease. In our results, at least, we have identified Thymosin $\beta$4, ubiquitin, BUB3, in addition to several novel proteins are candidates for targeted proteins in oral cancers. Validation of Thymosin $\beta$4 protein expression in N/T paired oral cancer tissue array by immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Thymosin $\beta$4 overexpression was found mainly in late clinical stage oral cancer samples. The thymosin $\beta$4/ILK/Akt pathway analysis also showed similar trend for the activation of this pathway in oral cancers. Altogether, the present findings also demonstrated that rich protein information can be produced by means of proteomic analysis for a better understanding of the oncogenesis and pathogenesis in a global way, which in turn is a basis for the rational designs of diagnostic and therapeutic methods in oral cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Local or regional lymph node recurrence is the most common pattern of treatment failure in oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The local recurrence rate is 30{\%} even when the surgical resection margin is diagnosed as tumour free. Accumulation of genetic changes in histologically normal epithelium in the surgical resection margin may explain the local recurrence rate. The purpose of this study is to investigate the presence of senescence markers, which may represent early malignant changes in the margin that in routine pathological evaluations are classified as histologically normal. METHODS: Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded surgical specimens from 16 consecutive patients with oral SCC and a clear surgical margin were obtained. The margin was analysed by immunohistochemistry for p53, p16, Chk2, Laminin-5 and glycosylated oncofetal fibronectin. RESULTS: Two patterns of p53 expression were found in the histologically normal epithelium in the surgical resection margin. One was characterized by no protein expression in the majority of cells, except for small clusters of basal and parabasal cells with nuclear staining. The other was characterized by p53 expression in the nuclei of most basal cells. The expression of p16 was confined to small groups of cells in the basal cell layer whereas Chk2 was only seen in one case. Upregulation of the stromal proteins, Laminin-5 or glycosylated oncofetal fibronectin, was only seen at regions of invasion. CONCLUSION: Small groups of cells expressing p53 and p16 were found in the surgical resection margin that appeared to be histologically normal and may represent early malignant changes.},

abstract = {PD-1 targeting antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) are now approved in various tumor types either as second line treatment (locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, advanced renal cell carcinoma, recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, classical Hodgkin lymphoma) or even as first line therapy (metastatic melanoma, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer). Despite an increase in response rate as well as survival, there is still issue with resistance to PD-1 targeting therapies. Selection biomarkers as well as response biomarkers are still under intensive research. In addition, combination strategies are needed to increase response rate and overcome resistance. Combination strategies were therefore tested in one well characterized syngeneic mouse model, i.e. EMT-6 breast carcinoma. The model is known to be highly sensitive to CTLA-4 targeting antibody (optimum tumor to control ratio (T/C) of 3{\%}), a moderate responder to PD-1 targeting treatment (best T/C of 54{\%}) and a well immune infiltrated tumor. Antibodies targeting co-stimulatory receptor such as OX40, GITR and 4-1BB as well as co-inhibitory receptor such as Tim3 were combined to anti-PD-1 antibody. In all cases, combination arm produces better therapeutic activity when compared to single treatment alone. Moreover, both strategies, meaning combination of two antibodies targeting co-inhibitory receptors (PD-1 + Tim3) and combination targeting one co-inhibitory (i.e. PD-1) and one co-stimulatory receptors (OX40, GITR or 4-1BB) worked. Detailed results will be presented including response rate, immune infiltrates and cytokines profiles in order to rationally choose the best therapeutic treatment.},

@article{Schroder2020,
abstract = {Purpose: The tumor microenvironment (TME) of HNSCCs is highly immunosuppressive. Tumor derived exosomes are key mediators of many pro-tumorigenic effects and exhibit strong immunosuppressive properties. So far, this has been established for T cells and other leukocyte populations, but the effects of exosomes on B cells remain to be elucidated. Here we show that exosomes purified from the plasma of HNSCC patients modify the phenotype of B cells. Methods: : Exosomes were isolated from plasma of HNSCC patients by mini size exclusion chromatography. B cells were purified from peripheral blood of healthy donors by LeukoSep and CD19-negative selection and co-cultured with HNSCC exosomes. Using flow cytometry, the expression of checkpoint receptors was determined. Adenosine production was assessed by luciferase assay. The activity of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway was inferred by measuring the expression of phosphorylated Bruton's tyrosine kinase (p-BTK). Results: Co-cultivation with HNSCC exosomes inhibited cluster formation of stimulated B cells. This was accompanied by a decrease in the expression of the co-stimulatory checkpoint receptor GITR and CD39, an ATP-hydrolyzing ectoenzyme. In line with this, ATP hydrolysis and adenosine production by exosome-treated B cells were decreased. Furthermore, the expression of p-BTK was reduced. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that exosomes derived from HNSCC patients have direct effects on B cells in vitro. We suspect a global inhibitory effect; since exosomes inhibited cluster formation; reduced the expression of a co-stimulatory receptor and decreased the activity of the BCR pathway.},

abstract = {Aim: This historical medical literature review aims at understanding the evolution of the medical existence of oral cancer over times, particularly better comprehending if the apparent lower prevalence of this type of cancer in antiquity is a real value due to the absence of modern environmental and lifestyle factors or it is linked to a misinterpretation of ancient foreign terms found in ancient medical texts regarding oral neoplasms. Methods: The databases MedLne, PubMed, Web of Science, Elsevier's EMBASE.com, Cochrane Review, National Library of Greece (Stavros Niarchos Foundation, Athens) and the Library of the School of Health Sciences of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (Greece) were extensively searched for relevant studies published during the past century on the history of oral cancer and its treatment from antiquity to modern times, in addition to the WHO website to analyse the latest epidemiological data. In addition, we included historical books on the topic of interest and original sources. Results: Historical references reveal that the cradle of the oral oncology was in ancient Egypt, the Asian continent and Greece and cancer management was confined to an approximate surgical practice, in order to remove abnormal masses and avoid bleeding with cauterization. In the Medieval Age, little progress occurred in medicine in general, oral cancers management included. It is only from the Renaissance to modern times that knowledge about its pathophysiological mechanisms and histopathology and its surgical and pharmacological treatment approaches became increasingly deep all over the world, evolving to the actual integrated treatment. Despite the abundant literature exploring oncology in past civilizations, the real prevalence of oral cancer in antiquity is much less known; but a literature analysis cannot exclude a consistent prevalence of this cancer in past populations, probably with a likely lower incidence than today, because many descriptions of its aggressiveness were found in ancient medical texts, but it is still difficult to be sure that each single description of oral masses could be associated to cancer, particularly for what concerns the period before the Middle Ages. Conclusions: Modern oncologists and oral surgeons must learn a lot from their historic counterparts in order to avoid past unsuccessful efforts to treatment oral malignancies. Several descriptions of oral cancers in the antiquity that we found let us think that this disease might be linked to mechanisms not strictly dependent on environmental risk factors, and this might guide future research on oral cavity treatments towards strategical cellular and molecular techniques.},

abstract = {In 1953, Slaughter et al. [D. P. Slaughter et al., Cancer (Phila.), 6: 963-968, 1953] proposed the concept of field cancerization in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) and discussed its clinical significance for the development of second primary tumors and local recurrences. To define the process of field cancerization and its putative clinical implications, we analyzed genetic aberrations in HNSCC and the accompanying macroscopically normal mucosa. In 28 HNSCC patients, loss of heterozygosity was determined in tumor and five noncontiguous mucosal biopsies using eight microsatellite markers at 9p, 3p, and 17p. For patients who showed loss of heterozygosity in their mucosal biopsies, all margins of the surgical specimen were subsequently analyzed to determine the extension of the field. In these cases, additional markers at 8p, 13q, and 18q as well as p53 mutations were included to determine subclonal differences between field and tumor. Genetically altered fields were detected in 36{\%} (10 of 28) of the HNSCC patients. The field varied in size between patients and consisted of genetically different subclones. In 7 of 10 cases, the field extended into the surgical margins. One particular patient with a genetically altered field in a surgical margin developed a local recurrence after 28 months of follow-up. Microsatellite analysis showed that this recurrence had more molecular markers in common with the nonresected premalignant field than with the original tumor, suggesting that this persistent field has progressed further into a new malignancy. Our data show that genetically altered mucosa remains after treatment in a significant proportion of HNSCC patients, which may explain in part the high frequency of local recurrences and second primary tumors. Adequate identification and risk assessment of these genetically altered fields may have profound implications for future patient management.},

abstract = {Background: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab that target the PD-1 immune check point have recently been approved in recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (R/M HNSCC) patients who have failed platinum therapy. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of selected immune genes' expression in a retrospective analysis of 96 untreated HNSCC patients. Methods: We retrieved 96 HNSCC patients who underwent primary surgery at Institut Curie between 1990 and 2006. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze a panel of 46 genes classified in immunity genes and tissue specific genes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of overexpressed genes. This study was approved by the internal review board of Institut Curie. Results: Median age was 56 years [range: 35-78]. 80{\%} of patients were men with a history of alcohol (70{\%}) and/or tobacco consumption (73{\%}). Twelve patients (12{\%}) were HPV-positive. Primary tumor location was oral cavity (45{\%}), oropharynx (21{\%}), larynx (18{\%}), and hypopharynx (17{\%}). Patients had stage I, II, III, and IVa in 10{\%}, 16{\%}, 13{\%}, and 61{\%}, respectively. Median disease-free interval was 23 months [range: 0.7- 185]. Most significantly overexpressed genes were OX40L (74{\%}), TNFRSF9 (77{\%}), and TNFRSF18 (74{\%}) immunity genes, and CD80 (80{\%}) and FOXP3 (62{\%}) tissue specific genes. Median disease-free interval was 11 months in high OX40L mRNA level HNSCC patients versus 23 months in low OX40L mRNA level HNSCC patients (p=0.0009). Conclusions: OX40L overexpression was associated with a poor outcome in HNSCC patients treated with primary surgery.},

abstract = {Background: MEDI1873 is a novel GITR-ligand/IgG1 agonist fusion protein that binds the co-stimulatory glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor family-related protein (GITR) on CD4+ and CD8+ effector T cells and regulatory T cells. This Phase 1 study evaluated safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, immunomodulatory effects and preliminary antitumor activity in pts with advanced solid tumors. Methods: MEDI1873 was administered IV Q2W. During dose escalation (DE), it was evaluated in 2 single pt cohorts (1.5 and 3 mg), followed by 3+3 DE in 6 cohorts (7.5, 25, 75, 250, 500 and 750 mg). Pts with NSCLC, HNSCC or CRC receiving 75 or 250 mg were evaluated in pharmacodynamic (PD) cohorts using biopsies pretreatment and at day 29. All pts had flow cytometric assessment of lymphocytes pre- and on-treatment up to day 43. Antitumor response was assessed using RECIST v 1.1. Results: As of 1 March 2018, 40 pts were dosed in the DE (28) and PD (12) cohorts. An MTD was not reached (maximum administered dose was 750 mg). Three DLTs occurred: Grade 3 worsening tumor pain at 250 mg, Grade 3 nausea and vomiting at 500 mg and Grade 3 non-STEMI at 750 mg. Any-grade drug-related AEs occurred in 82.5{\%} of pts, most commonly headache (25{\%}) and infusion related reaction (IRR, 20{\%}). Grade 3 drug-related AEs occurred in 22.5{\%} of pts; amylase increase was the only one reported in{\textgreater}1 pt (n=2). There were no drug-related Grade 4 or 5 AEs. PK was dose-proportional over a range of 1.5 to 500 mg; elimination half-life was approximately 2 days. Anti-drug antibody incidence was low with minimal PK impact. MEDI1873 engaged GITR on CD4+ T cells and increased CD4+Ki67+ T cells at doses ≥25 mg. Intratumorally, MEDI1873 induced a≥25{\%} decrease in GITR+/FOXP3+ T cells in 5 of 5 pts with evaluable cells. Immune PD changes were observed in 8 pts who underwent paired biopsies. Best overall response was stable disease (SD) in 42.5{\%} of pts; 17.5{\%} had SD≥24 weeks. Three pts (pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, lung cancer and mesothelioma) stayed on MEDI1873 for ≥52 weeks without progression. Conclusions: MEDI1873 has an acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated pts with solid tumors. PD changes in blood and tumor coupled with prolonged SD in several pts support further clinical exploration of doses ≥250 mg.},

abstract = {Overview An enigma for cancer medicine lies in its complexity and variability, at all levels of consideration. The hallmarks of cancer constitute an organizing principle that provides a conceptual basis for distilling the complexity of this disease in order to better understand it in its diverse presentations. This conceptualization involves eight biological capabilities?the hallmarks of cancer?acquired by cancer cells during the long process of tumor development and malignant progression. Two characteristic traits of cancer cells facilitate the acquisition of these functional capabilities. The eight distinct hallmarks consist of sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion and metastasis, deregulating cellular energetics and metabolism, and avoiding immune destruction. The principal facilitators of their acquisition are genome instability with consequent gene mutation and tumor-promoting inflammation. The integration of these hallmark capabilities involves heterotypic interactions among multiple cell types populating the ?tumor microenvironment? (TME), which is composed of cancer cells and a tumor-associated stroma, including three prominent classes of recruited support cells?angiogenic vascular cells (AVC), various subtypes of fibroblasts, and infiltrating immune cells (IIC). In addition, the neoplastic cells populating individual tumors are themselves typically heterogeneous, in that cancer cells can assume a variety of distinctive phenotypic states and undergo genetic diversification during tumor progression. Accordingly, the hallmarks of cancer?this set of necessarily acquired capabilities and their facilitators?constitute a useful heuristic tool for elucidating mechanistic bases and commonalties underlying the pathogenesis of diverse forms of human cancer, with potential applications to cancer therapy.},

abstract = {Objective: To provide a review of emerging knowledge from genomics and related basic science, preclinical, and clinical precision medicine studies in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Data Sources: The Cancer Genome Atlas Network (TCGA) publications, PubMed-based literature review, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Review Methods: TCGA publications, PubMed, and ClinicalTrials.gov were queried for genomics and related basic science, preclinical, and developmental clinical precision medicine studies in HNSCC. Results: TCGA reported comprehensive genomic analyses of 279 HNSCC, defining the landscape and frequency of chromosomal copy number alterations, mutations, and expressed genes that contribute to pathogenesis, prognosis, and resistance to therapy. This provides a road map for basic science and preclinical studies to identify key pathways in cancer and cells of the tumor microenvironment affected by these alterations, and candidate targets for new small molecule and biologic therapies. Conclusion: Recurrent chromosomal abnormalities, mutations, and expression of genes affecting HNSCC subsets are associated with differences in prognosis, and define molecules, pathways, and deregulated immune responses as candidates for therapy. Activity of molecularly targeted agents appears to be enhanced by rational combinations of these agents and standard therapies targeting the complex alterations that affect multiple pathways and mechanisms in HNSCC.NA.},

abstract = {Objective: We recently showed that tumors with an immunologically ‘cold' phenotype are enriched for expression of stemness-associated genes and PVR/CD155, the ligand of the immunosuppressive molecule TIGIT. To explore the therapeutic implications of this finding, we investigated the relationship between PVR/CD155 expression, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), and prognosis in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) and other cancers. Methods: Expression of CD155, TIGIT, PD-1, PD-L1, and other immune markers in HGSC was assessed by high-dimensional flow cytometry, multi-color histological imaging, and/or gene expression profiling. The prognostic significance of PVR/CD155 and CD274/PD-L1 expression was assessed bioinformatically in HGSC and 32 other cancers in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Results: T cells from HGSC frequently co-expressed TIGIT and PD-1, and the ratio of TIGIT to PD-1 expression increased markedly after in vitro expansion with a clinically relevant protocol. CD155 was commonly expressed on malignant epithelium in HGSC and showed a negative or non-significant association with TIL. In contrast, PD-L1 was predominantly expressed by tumor-associated macrophages and positively associated with TIL. These contrasts between CD155 and PD-L1 were seen across HGSC patients, across metastatic sites within individual patients, and even within individual tumor deposits. PVR/CD155 and CD274/PD-L1 exhibited divergent prognostic associations across diverse cancer types in TCGA, including HGSC. Conclusions: CD155 and PD-L1 exhibit contrasting expression patterns, TIL associations and prognostic significance, suggesting they represent non-redundant immunosuppressive mechanisms. The CD155/TIGIT pathway represents a compelling immunotherapeutic target for HGSC and for immunologically cold tumors in general.},

abstract = {Field cancerization was first described in 1953 as histologically altered epithelium surrounding tumor samples taken from the upper aerodigestive tract. Since then, the term has been used to describe multiple patches of pre-malignant disease, a higher-than-expected prevalence of multiple local second primary tumors, and the presence of synchronous distant tumors within the upper aerodigestive tract. Molecular techniques such as karyotype analysis, microsatellite analysis, p53 mutation screening, and X-chromosome inactivation studies have further refined the relationship among these lesions. While there are differences in the techniques used to identify the clonal origins of the lesions, these studies indicate that there is often lateral clonal spread of pre-malignant or malignant disease, and a significant portion of local second primary tumors are in fact genetically related. Distant second primary tumors found in the esophagus are often not related to concurrent head and neck cancer, whereas synchronous squamous lung tumors with a head and neck primary are often, in fact, metastases, rather than independently arising malignancies. These observations help to explain the high incidence of recurrent disease, despite excision or other therapy?pre-malignant or malignant clones often have the ability to migrate and persist outside of the field of treatment. Therefore, alternative means of prevention or therapy that can affect the entire head and neck region may be of benefit to such patients. Future studies will further refine the relationship among these lesions and perhaps identify key molecular alterations to be used as targets for gene therapy.},

Cancer treatment by chemotherapy or immune checkpoint inhibition can lead to changes of checkpoint expression, which influences therapy success. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were isolated from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients (n = 23) and compared to healthy donors (n = 23). Immune checkpoint expression (programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-1), tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-related (GITR), CD137, tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 4 (TNFRSF4) (OX40), t-cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain containing-3 (TIM3), B-and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3)) was determined on immune cells by flow cytometry. PD-L1 expression was detected on tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry. Immune cells were treated with immuno-and chemotherapeutics to investigate treatment-specific change in immune checkpoint expression, in vitro. Specific changes of immune checkpoint expression were identified on PBL and TIL of HNSCC patients compared to healthy donors. Various chemotherapeutics acted differently on the expression of immune checkpoints. Changes of checkpoint expression were significantly less pronounced on regulatory T cells compared to other lymphocyte populations. Nivolumab treatment significantly reduced the receptor PD-1 on all analyzed T cell populations, in vitro. The specific immune checkpoint expression patterns in HNSCC patients and the investigated effects of immunomodulatory agents may improve the development and efficacy of targeted immunotherapy.},

abstract = {Background: Nivolumab and pembrolizumab targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have recently been approved among patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who failed platinum therapy. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of selected immune gene expression in HNSCC. Patients and methods: We retrospectively assessed the expression of 46 immune-related genes and immune-cell subpopulation genes including immune checkpoints by real-time polymerase chain reaction among 96 patients with HNSCC who underwent primary surgery at Institut Curie between 1990 and 2006. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of dysregulated genes. Results: The Median age of the population was 56 years [range: 35–78]. Primary tumour location was oral cavity (45{\%}), oropharynx (21{\%}), larynx (18{\%}) and hypopharynx (17{\%}). Twelve patients (13{\%}) had an oropharyngeal human papillomavirus–positive tumour. Most significantly overexpressed immune-related genes were TNFRSF9/4-1BB (77{\%}), IDO1 (75{\%}), TNFSF4/OX40L (74{\%}) and TNFRSF18/GITR (74{\%}), and immune-cell subpopulation gene was FOXP3 (62{\%}). Eighty-five percent of tumours analysed overexpressed actionable immunity genes, including PD-1/PD-L1, TIGIT, OX40/OX40L and/or CTLA4. Among the immune-related genes, high OX40L mRNA level (p = 0.0009) and low PD-1 mRNA level (p = 0.004) were associated with the highest risk of recurrence. Among the immune-cell subpopulation genes, patients with high PDGFRB mRNA level (p {\textless} 0.0001) and low CD3E (p = 0.0009) or CD8A mRNA levels (p = 0.004) were also at the highest risk of recurrence. Conclusions: OX40L and PDGFRB overexpression was associated with poor outcomes, whereas PD-1 overexpression was associated with good prognosis in patients with HNSCC treated with primary surgery, suggesting their relevance as potential prognostic biomarkers and major therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.},

Design A total of 403 subjects (205 cancer cases and 198 healthy controls) who habitually chewed BQ were recruited. The genotypes were determined by TaqMan real-time assays. Results G allele and G/G genotype at TNFA −308 were associated with a 1.95-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.16–3.28, pcorrected = 0.024) and 2.28-fold (95{\%}CI: 1.30–4.00, pcorrected = 0.008) increased risk of cancer as compared to those with A allele or A/A + A/G genotypes, respectively. In addition, G allele (p = 0.080) and G/G genotype (p = 0.076) at TNFA −238 were associated with a borderline but statistically significant increased risk of OPSCC. The combined G/G + G/G genotype at both loci had a 2.37-fold increased risk of OPSCC as compared to those with other combined genotypes (95{\%}CI: 1.41–4.00, p = 0.001). Interactions between combined genotypes and smoking status were also found to contribute to risk of BQ-related OPSCC. There was no association of TNFA genotypes with clinicopathologic findings or the survival of OPSCC patients. Conclusions BQ-chewers who carry the G allele or G/G genotype in TNFA −308 may have an increased risk of OPSCC.

In this study, 403 male subjects who habitually chewed BQ were recruited: 205 OPSCC case patients and 198 healthy controls. Case patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, and pathologically confirmed primary OPSCC (of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and hypopharynx) were recruited between January 2004 and November 2007 from the Department of ENT and Dentistry at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital (KSVGH). Case patients with complete follow up (195, 95.12{\%}) and annual reviews of medical records entered the survival analysis.

The 198 healthy controls were recruited from the oral health screen clinic at the Department of Otolaryngology, KSVGH and from the oral health screen campaigns for vehicle drivers, cleaners, and hardware workers held by the Kaohsiung city government or Department of Otolaryngology, KSVGH between 2004 and 2007. The selection criteria for controls included the absence of history of cancer and oral precancerous lesions, and negative screening for oral precancerous lesions. Controls were frequency-matched to case patients on age (±5 years), ethnicity, and years of BQ chewing.

After signing an informed consent, each subject was interviewed using a structured questionnaire that elicited detailed information on the history of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking habits, and the general demographic data. At the end of the interview, each subject donated 7–15 ml of blood in an EDTA tube according to the protocol that had been approved by the Institutional Review Board of KSVGH.},

Here, we report a whole transcriptome profile on a batch of GBSCC tumours with diverse tobacco usage habits. The study provides an entire landscape of altered expression with an emphasis on searching for targets with therapeutic potential. Methods: Whole transcriptomes of 12 GBSCC tumours and adjacent normal tissues were sequenced and analysed to explore differential expression of genes. Expression changes were further compared with those in TCGA head and neck cohort (n = 263) data base and validated in an independent set of 10GBSCC samples. Results: Differentially expressed genes (n = 2176) were used to cluster the patients based on their tobacco habits, resulting in 3 subgroups. Immune response was observed to be significantly aberrant, along with cell adhesion and lipid metabolism processes. Different modes of immune evasion were seen across 12 tumours with up-regulation or consistent expression of CD47, unlike other immune evasion genes such as PDL1, FUT4, CTLA4 and BTLA which were downregulated in a few samples. Variation in infiltrating immune cell signatures across tumours also indicates heterogeneity in immune evasion strategies. A few actionable genes such as ITGA4, TGFB1 and PTGS1/COX1 were over expressed in most samples. Conclusion: This study found expression deregulation of key immune evasion genes, such as CD47 and PDL1, and reasserts their potential as effective immunotherapeutic targets for GBSCC, which requires further clinical studies. Present findings reiterate the idea of using transcriptome profiling to guide precision therapeutic strategies.},

The immune system is generally divided into 2 primary components: the innate immune response, and the highly specific but more slowly developing adaptive or acquired immune response. Immune responses can be further separated by whether they are induced by exposure to a foreign antigen (an "active" response) or whether they are transferred through serum or lymphocytes from an immunized individual (a "passive" response). The ideal cancer immunotherapy agent should be able to discriminate between cancer and normal cells (ie, specificity), be potent enough to kill small or large numbers of tumor cells (ie, sensitivity), and lastly be able to prevent recurrence of the tumor (ie, durability). Tumor immunology and immunotherapy is one of the most exciting and rapidly expanding fields at present. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

However, it should be noted that the proportion of patients who have objective and durable responses to immune checkpoint blockade remains less than 30{\%} in majority of cancers. Thus, in addition to refine the usage of existing drugs for checkpoint blockade, identification and characterization of novel checkpoint molecules other than CTLA-4 and PD-1 is a highly anticipated research subject. In addition, agonists of stimulatory co-signal molecules have a potential to further improve anti-tumor effects, rendering them attractive in research and drug development.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Oral lichen planus (OLP) is an immune-mediated mucocutaneous disease of  uncertain aetiology. OLP has many manifestations: reticular, erosive, atrophic, plaque like, papular, bullous, with unique etiopathogenetic working. The purpose of this study is to find a link between different clinical types of lichen and the alterations of lymphocytes on peripheral blood and oral mucosa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age of patients was 53.82 years, between 31 and 78 years. OLP Diagnosis was afterwards confirmed by histopathology. Selected patients underwent to clinical evaluation, lesion characterization, incisional biopsy, samples histological analysis, peripheral blood collection. Blood specimens were submitted to cell count determination with differential, characterization of populations and circulating lymphocyte subpopulations using monoclonal antibodies in flow cytometry. Referring to the clinical presentation of lesions, patients were divided in two groups: red lesions (RL) and white lesions (WL) and compared with an age-matched control group. RESULTS: The results of the immunophenotypic study showed correlation between WL and the expression of CD19 lymphocytes (r = 0.693, P = 0.0005). The results of immunohistochemical study performed on histological specimens showed a significant correlation between RL group and expression of all lymphocyte tested (CD3 r = 0.722 P = 0.0002, CD4 r = 0.579 P = 0.0060, CD56 r = 0.513 P = 0.0173, CD8 r = 0.548 P = 0.0102). CONCLUSIONS: We assume there is the responsibility of the expression of lymphocytes, not only type but also as quantity, in determining RL or WL manifestation of OLP. Circulating lymphocytes may have a role, too.},

abstract = {Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a major health concern worldwide. We applied the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to analyze paired normal (N) and tumor (T) samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in HNSCC cell lines to identify tumor-associated biomarkers. Our results showed a number of proteins found to be over- expressed in HNSCC. We identified thymosin beta-4 X-linked (TMSB4X) is one of the most significant candidate biomarkers. Higher TMSB4X expression in the tumor was found by N/T-paired HNSCC samples at both RNA and protein level. Overexpression of TMSB4X was found significantly associated with poor prognosis of overall survival (OS, P = 0.006) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.013) in HNSCC patients. Silencing of TMSB4X expression in HNSCC cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro, as well as inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. Altogether, our global proteomics analysis identified that TMSB4X is a newly discovered biomarker in HNSCC whose functions resulted in enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. TMSB4X may be a potential therapeutic target for treating HNSCC patients.},

@article{Kim2013a,
abstract = {Background: Gene expression profiles have been broadly used in cancer research as a diagnostic or prognostic signature for the clinical outcome prediction such as stage, grade, metastatic status, recurrence, and patient survival, as well as to potentially improve patient management. However, emerging evidence shows that gene expression-based prediction varies between independent data sets. One possible explanation of this effect is that previous studies were focused on identifying genes with large main effects associated with clinical outcomes. Thus, non-linear interactions without large individual main effects would be missed. The other possible explanation is that gene expression as a single level of genomic data is insufficient to explain the clinical outcomes of interest since cancer can be dysregulated by multiple alterations through genome, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome levels. In order to overcome the variability of diagnostic or prognostic predictors from gene expression alone and to increase its predictive power, we need to integrate multi-levels of genomic data and identify interactions between them associated with clinical outcomes. Results: Here, we proposed an integrative framework for identifying interactions within/between multi-levels of genomic data associated with cancer clinical outcomes using the Grammatical Evolution Neural Networks (GENN). In order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed framework, ovarian cancer data from TCGA was used as a pilot task. We found not only interactions within a single genomic level but also interactions between multi-levels of genomic data associated with survival in ovarian cancer. Notably, the integration model from different levels of genomic data achieved 72.89{\%} balanced accuracy and outperformed the top models with any single level of genomic data. Conclusions: Understanding the underlying tumorigenesis and progression in ovarian cancer through the global view of interactions within/between different levels of genomic data is expected to provide guidance for improved prognostic biomarkers and individualized therapies. {\textcopyright} 2013Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

This study aims to examine the incidence and clinical presentation of oral malignancies associated with OLP. A retrospective study was made of 550 patients diagnosed with OLP according to the criteria of the World Health Organization, in the period between 1991 and 2007, in south-eastern Spain 128 males (23.3{\%}) and 422 females (76.7{\%}). A clinical protocol was applied in all cases (sociodemographic data, habits and hepatitis C markers), with histological confirmation of the disease. Five of the 550 patients (0.9{\%}) developed SCC. The mean duration of follow-up was 24+/-20.83 months. The tongue was the most common location. The exact incidence of malignant transformation of OLP is difficult to establish, due to the possible contribution of external risk factors that may be of relevance in oral malignancy.},

abstract = {Summary
Objective
To describe trends in country and sex-specific incidence rates of head and neck cancer (HNC), focusing on changes across calendar periods.
Materials and Methods
Sex and country specific rates of HNC were calculated for 1998–2002 and 1983–1987 using population-based registry data assembled by the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) data system for 83 registries representing 35 countries. HNCs were categorized into three groups: oral cavity (including tongue and mouth), oropharynx (including tonsil and oropharynx) and other HNC (including larynx and poorly-specified tumors of the lip/oral cavity/pharynx). Age-standardized rates per 100,000 persons were calculated using the 1960 world standard population. Changes in rates between 1998–2002 and 1993–1987 were assessed.
Results
During these periods there was substantial global variation in HNC incidence trends by cancer site, country/registry and sex. Rates of oral cavity cancer increased among men and women in some European and Asian countries (Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, the United Kingdom and Japan). In France and Italy, rates declined among men but increased among women. Oral cavity incidence rates declined among men and women in many Asian registries as well as in Canada and the United States. Oropharyngeal cancer rates increased among both men and women in a number of European countries (Belarus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Norway and the United Kingdom) whereas they declined in some Asian countries. The largest increase in oropharyngeal rates was among Brazilian men. Rates of other HNCs varied substantially by country and sex.
Conclusion
From 1983–1987 to 1998–2002, trends in HNC rates differed by subtype, country and sex. Oral cavity cancer incidence rates increased in many countries with tobacco epidemics that are currently peaking and declined in areas where tobacco use peaked some time ago. In contrast, rates of oropharyngeal cancer increased in a number of countries where tobacco use has declined, perhaps due to the emerging importance of human papillomavirus infection. Continued monitoring of trends in incidence rates is needed to inform global cancer prevention strategies.},

abstract = {In the present study, epithelium derived lesions of various pathological manifestations were examined histologically and immunohistochemically for mononuclear cell infiltration. The infiltrate under the transformed epithelium of oral lesions, was examined for differences in the composition of immune mononuclear cells as the epithelium moves from hyperkeratosis through various degrees of dysplasia to squamous cell carcinoma. The study was performed on 53 human tongue tissues diagnosed as hyperkeratosis (11 cases), mild dysplasia (nine cases), moderate and severe dysplasia (14 cases) and squamous cell carcinoma (19 cases). A similar analysis was performed on 30 parotid gland tissues diagnosed as pleomorphic adenoma (14 cases) and carcinoma ex-pleomorphic adenoma (16 cases). Immunohistochemical analysis of various surface markers of the tumour infiltrating immune cells was performed and correlated with the transformation level as defined by morphology and the expression of p53 in the epithelium. The results revealed that, in the tongue lesions, the changes in the epithelium from normal appearance to transformed were accompanied by a corresponding increase in the infiltration of CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19+20, and HLA/DR positive cells. The most significant change was an increase in B lymphocytes in tongue lesions, that was in accordance with the transformation level (P{\textless}0.001). In the salivary gland, a significant number of cases did not show an infiltrate. In cases where an infiltrate was present, a similar pattern was observed and the more malignant tissues exhibited a higher degree of immune cell infiltration.},

abstract = {p53 mutations are etiologically associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs) or are associated with exposure to specific carcinogens. In this study, we used PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing to analyze the conserved regions of the p53 gene (exons 5-9) in OSCC tumor specimens from 187 patients with varied histories of betel quid, tobacco and alcohol use. Ninety-one of the 187 OSCCs (48.66{\%}) showed p53 gene mutations at exons 5-9. The incidence of p53 mutations was not associated with age, sex, TNM stage, status of cigarette smoking or betel quid chewing. However, alcohol drinkers exhibited a significantly higher incidence (57/101, 56.44{\%}) of p53 mutations than non-users (39.53{\%}, 34/86) (P = 0.02). The effect of alcohol on the incidence of p53 mutations was still statistically significant (RR = 2.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.21-4.15) after adjustment for cigarette smoking and betel quid (BQ) chewing. G:C to A:T transitions were the predominant mutations observed and associated with BQ and tobacco use. Alcohol drinking could enhance these transitions. After adjustment for cigarette smoking and BQ chewing, alcohol drinking still showed an independent effect on G:C to A:T transitions (RR = 2.41; 95{\%} CI, 1.01-5.74). These findings strongly suggest an important contributive role of tobacco carcinogens to p53 mutation in this series of Taiwanese OSCCs and alcohol might enhance these mutagenic effects. As safrole-DNA adducts have been detected in 77{\%} (23/30) of the OSCC tissues from Taiwanese oral cancer patients with a BQ chewing history, we cannot rule out the possibility that safrole or other carcinogens present in the BQ may cause a similar pattern of mutagenesis. Determination of the role of safrole and other carcinogens present in BQ on the pattern of p53 gene mutation in OSCC will require further study.},

Genes are classified according to their function in several different ways: families and subfamilies are annotated with ontology terms (Gene Ontology (GO) and PANTHER protein class), and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. The PANTHER website includes a suite of tools that enable users to browse and query gene functions, and to analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. It is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. In the 2013 release of PANTHER (v.8.0), in addition to an update of the data content, we redesigned the website interface to improve both user experience and the system's analytical capability. This protocol provides a detailed description of how to analyze genome-wide experimental data with the PANTHER classification system.},

It is worth pointing out that other similar tools exist to perform overrepresentation and enrichment tests, most notably GSEA32 and DAVID33. Although all three tools use very similar statistical algorithms in the back end, there are some differences among them. GSEA requires download and installation, and thus its target users are computer-savvy bioinformaticians. Both DAVID and PANTHER are online tools and are more appealing to bench biologists. Compared with DAVID, PANTHER has a few advantages. First, PANTHER is currently part of GO, and it integrates more updated GO curation data with the tools. In fact, DAVID downloads PANTHER data and integrates them in its analysis tools. Second, PANTHER enables users to analyze genome data from 82 organisms using the online tool, and to analyze data from any other organisms using the PANTHER scoring tool. Third, the phylogenetic trees in PANTHER protein library enable users to make more accurate ortholog prediction and thus greatly enhance the capability of the tools. One weakness of PANTHER is that it cannot analyze data against resources outside of PANTHER, such as KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) and Reactome$\backslash$cite{\{}Mi2013{\}}.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIM: p53 mutations are critical players in etiopathogenesis of oral cancer. Interestingly, they show differences in terms of type and codon specificity. These differences might be attributed to geographical variations in tobacco use. We aimed to analyze the frequency of p53 mutations in oral cancer patients from Gujarat, India and their effect on clinico-pathological features, local recurrence and survival. MATERIAL AND METHODS: p53 mutation analysis was performed on 46 paired tissue samples (adjacent normal and primary malignant) using PCR-SSCP and sequencing. RESULTS: Sequencing confirmed 51 p53 mutations in 46 paired tissues. Three novel mutations (frameshift deletion in exon 4; G{\textgreater}T transversion at codon 117 in exon 4 and G{\textgreater}A transition at codon 319 in exon 9) were identified. Distinct pattern of p53 mutations was observed: more common C{\textgreater}T transitions and recurring mutation sites at codon 90 and 116 in exon 4. Interestingly, the probability of developing recurrence was higher in small tumors ({\textless}4 cm) with p53 mutations and in cases with p53 mutations in both adjacent normal and malignant tissues. A significant low disease free survival and overall survival was observed in cases harboring truncating and transcriptionally non-active mutations. CONCLUSION: We report a very high frequency and a diverse pattern of p53 mutations in cases from this region. Interestingly, three distinct novel mutations in exons 4 and 9 were also observed. Analyzing p53 mutation status in tumor tissues at an early stage could serve as an important prognostic factor.},

The case group consisted of 104 male and 3 female oral cancer patients and these were compared with 194 male and 6 female matched controls. We found by univariate analysis that alcohol consumption, smoking, betel quid chewing, educational level and occupation were associated with oral cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were to be found elevated in patients who were smoking and betel quid chewing. After adjusting for education and occupation covariates, the incidence of oral cancer was computed to be 123‐fold higher in patients who smoked, drank alcohol and chewed betel quid than in obstainers. The synergistic effects of alcohol, tobacco smoke and betel quid in oral cancer were clearly demonstrated, but there was a statistically significant association between oral cancer and betel quid chewing alone. Swallowing betel quid juice (saliva extract of betel quid produced by chewing) or including unripened betel fruit in the quid both seemed to enhance the risks of contracting oral cancer.

Our hypothesis stated the selected genes in our final model would be enriched for pathways involved in drug metabolism or cell signaling. To test this hypothesis, we performed two statistical tests. First, we performed a PANTHER overrepresentation test. Using the results of the PANTHER analysis, we performed a t-test comparing the mean gene expression of responders and non-responders for the top twenty pathways based on the percent of genes hit against the total number of genes in the pathway (See Table S2, Additional file 1).

Answers to questions of whether dinosaurs had cancer, or if cancer plagued ancient civilizations, have captured the imagination as well as the popular media. Evidence for dinosaurian cancer may indicate that cancer may have been with us from the dawn of time. Ancient recorded history suggests that past civilizations attempted to fight cancer with a variety of interventions. When contemplating the issue why a generalized cure for cancer has not been found, it might prove useful to reflect on the relatively limited time that this issue has been an agenda item of governmental attention as well as continued introduction of an every evolving myriad of manmade carcinogens relative to the total time cancer has been present on planet Earth.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: TP53 gene-mutation and expression of p53 have been described  to influence the radiosensitivity of tumour cells from head and neck carcinomas. The present study was performed to evaluate whether TP53 mutation may influence the clinical outcome of head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from primary biopsies taken before radiotherapy. Gene mutations (in exons 5-9) were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as the initial scanning procedure and characterized by sequencing. Patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or surgery alone. Treatment was given according to the DAHANCA schedules with 5 or 6 weekly fractions (2 Gy) of radiotherapy (66-68 Gy). Most patients were also treated with the hypoxic radiosensitizer Nimorazole. The results are reported as 5-year actuarial values, and differences estimated by log-rank analysis. RESULTS: The present analysis is based on 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx and oral cavity diagnosed between March 1992 and October 1996. Ninety patients received primary radiotherapy alone and 21 were treated with surgery. TP53 mutations were found in 45 patients (39{\%}) and in patients receiving radiotherapy, TP53 mutation was highly associated with poor prognosis. Loco-regional control rates (5-year actuarial values) for TP53 mutation was 29 vs. 54{\%} for TP53 wildtype (P {\textless} 0.01). For disease-free survival the corresponding values were 13 and 38{\%} (P {\textless} 0.01), respectively. The correlations were not found to be related to specific subtypes of mutations (e.g. missense mutations affecting DNA-contact or Zn-binding regions) but rather to the presence of any mutation at all. In contrast, TP53 mutation did not influence the response to surgery. CONCLUSIONS: A strong relationship was observed between TP53 mutation and poor prognosis (increased risk of loco-regional failure and death) in head and neck cancer patients given primary radiotherapy but not surgery.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6{\%} of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4{\%} of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6{\%}), prostate cancer (7.1{\%}), and colorectal cancer (6.1{\%}) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2{\%}), stomach cancer (8.2{\%}), and liver cancer (8.2{\%}) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

abstract = {Background: Changing population-level exposure to modifiable risk factors is a key driver of changing cancer incidence. Understanding these changes is therefore vital when prioritising risk-reduction policies, in order to have the biggest impact on reducing cancer incidence. UK figures on the number of risk factor-attributable cancers are updated here to reflect changing behaviour as assessed in representative national surveys, and new epidemiological evidence. Figures are also presented by UK constituent country because prevalence of risk factor exposure varies between them. Methods: Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated for combinations of risk factor and cancer type with sufficient/convincing evidence of a causal association. Relative risks (RRs) were drawn from meta-analyses of cohort studies where possible. Prevalence of exposure to risk factors was obtained from nationally representative population surveys. Cancer incidence data for 2015 were sourced from national data releases and, where needed, personal communications. PAF calculations were stratified by age, sex and risk factor exposure level and then combined to create summary PAFs by cancer type, sex and country. Results: Nearly four in ten (37.7{\%}) cancer cases in 2015 in the UK were attributable to known risk factors. The proportion was around two percentage points higher in UK males (38.6{\%}) than in UK females (36.8{\%}). Comparing UK countries, the attributable proportion was highest in Scotland (41.5{\%} for persons) and lowest in England (37.3{\%} for persons). Tobacco smoking contributed by far the largest proportion of attributable cancer cases, followed by overweight/obesity, accounting for 15.1{\%} and 6.3{\%}, respectively, of all cases in the UK in 2015. For 10 cancer types, including two of the five most common cancer types in the UK (lung cancer and melanoma skin cancer), more than 70{\%} of UK cancer cases were attributable to known risk factors. Conclusion: Tobacco and overweight/obesity remain the top contributors of attributable cancer cases. Tobacco smoking has the highest PAF because it greatly increases cancer risk and has a large number of cancer types associated with it. Overweight/obesity has the second-highest PAF because it affects a high proportion of the UK population and is also linked with many cancer types. Public health policy may seek to mitigate the level of harm associated with exposure or reduce exposure levels - both approaches may effectively impact cancer incidence. Differences in PAFs between countries and sexes are primarily due to varying prevalence of exposure to risk factors and varying proportions of specific cancer types. This variation in turn is affected by socio-demographic differences which drive differences in exposure to theoretically avoidable 'lifestyle' factors. PAFs at UK country level have not been available previously and they should be used by policymakers in devolved nations. PAFs are estimates based on the best available data, limitations in those data would generally bias toward underestimation of PAFs. Regular collection of risk factor exposure prevalence data which corresponds with epidemiological evidence is vital for analyses like this and should remain a priority for the UK Government and devolved Administrations.},

abstract = {We performed an extensive immunogenomic analysis of more than 10,000 tumors comprising 33 diverse cancer types by utilizing data compiled by TCGA. Across cancer types, we identified six immune subtypes—wound healing, IFN-$\gamma$ dominant, inflammatory, lymphocyte depleted, immunologically quiet, and TGF-$\beta$ dominant—characterized by differences in macrophage or lymphocyte signatures, Th1:Th2 cell ratio, extent of intratumoral heterogeneity, aneuploidy, extent of neoantigen load, overall cell proliferation, expression of immunomodulatory genes, and prognosis. Specific driver mutations correlated with lower (CTNNB1, NRAS, or IDH1) or higher (BRAF, TP53, or CASP8) leukocyte levels across all cancers. Multiple control modalities of the intracellular and extracellular networks (transcription, microRNAs, copy number, and epigenetic processes) were involved in tumor-immune cell interactions, both across and within immune subtypes. Our immunogenomics pipeline to characterize these heterogeneous tumors and the resulting data are intended to serve as a resource for future targeted studies to further advance the field. Thorsson et al. present immunogenomics analyses of more than 10,000 tumors, identifying six immune subtypes that encompass multiple cancer types and are hypothesized to define immune response patterns impacting prognosis. This work provides a resource for understanding tumor-immune interactions, with implications for identifying ways to advance research on immunotherapy.},

We review the sources and methods used in compiling the national cancer incidence and mortality estimates, and briefly describe the key results by cancer site and in 20 large "areas" of the world. Overall, there were 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012. The most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung (1.82 million), breast (1.67 million), and colorectal (1.36 million); the most common causes of cancer death were lung cancer (1.6 million deaths), liver cancer (745,000 deaths), and stomach cancer (723,000 deaths).},

abstract = {Although the associations of p53 dysfunction, p53 interaction networks and oncogenesis have been widely explored, a systematic analysis of TP53 mutations and its related interaction networks in various types of human cancers is lacking. Our study explored the associations of TP53 mutations, gene expression, clinical outcomes, and TP53 interaction networks across 33 cancer types using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We show that TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in a number of cancers, and its mutations appear to be early events in cancer initiation. We identified genes potentially repressed by p53, and genes whose expression correlates significantly with TP53 expression. These gene products may be especially important nodes in p53 interaction networks in human cancers. This study shows that while TP53-truncating mutations often result in decreased TP53 expression, other non-truncating TP53 mutations result in increased TP53 expression in some cancers. Survival analyses in a number of cancers show that patients with TP53 mutations are more likely to have worse prognoses than TP53-wildtype patients, and that elevated TP53 expression often leads to poor clinical outcomes. We identified a set of candidate synthetic lethal (SL) genes for TP53, and validated some of these SL interactions using data from the Cancer Cell Line Project. These predicted SL genes are promising candidates for experimental validation and the development of personalized therapeutics for patients with TP53-mutated cancers.},

abstract = {Background Nivolumab and pembrolizumab targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have recently been approved among patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) who failed platinum therapy. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of selected immune gene expression in HNSCC. Patients and methods We retrospectively assessed the expression of 46 immune-related genes and immune-cell subpopulation genes including immune checkpoints by real-time polymerase chain reaction among 96 patients with HNSCC who underwent primary surgery at Institut Curie between 1990 and 2006. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic value of dysregulated genes. Results The Median age of the population was 56 years [range: 35–78]. Primary tumour location was oral cavity (45{\%}), oropharynx (21{\%}), larynx (18{\%}) and hypopharynx (17{\%}). Twelve patients (13{\%}) had an oropharyngeal human papillomavirus–positive tumour. Most significantly overexpressed immune-related genes were TNFRSF9/4-1BB (77{\%}), IDO1 (75{\%}), TNFSF4/OX40L (74{\%}) and TNFRSF18/GITR (74{\%}), and immune-cell subpopulation gene was FOXP3 (62{\%}). Eighty-five percent of tumours analysed overexpressed actionable immunity genes, including PD-1/PD-L1, TIGIT, OX40/OX40L and/or CTLA4. Among the immune-related genes, high OX40L mRNA level (p = 0.0009) and low PD-1 mRNA level (p = 0.004) were associated with the highest risk of recurrence. Among the immune-cell subpopulation genes, patients with high PDGFRB mRNA level (p {\textless} 0.0001) and low CD3E (p = 0.0009) or CD8A mRNA levels (p = 0.004) were also at the highest risk of recurrence. Conclusions OX40L and PDGFRB overexpression was associated with poor outcomes, whereas PD-1 overexpression was associated with good prognosis in patients with HNSCC treated with primary surgery, suggesting their relevance as potential prognostic biomarkers and major therapeutic targets.},
