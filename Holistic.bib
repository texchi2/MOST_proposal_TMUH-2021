abstract = {Background: Neuroendocrine dysregulation influenced by psychosocial stress is related to breast cancer recurrence. Very few studies examine the impacts of psychotherapy on diurnal cortisol patterns among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Forty-eight breast cancer patients who completed active cancer treatment were randomly assigned to receive either 8 weekly body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy sessions or 1 educational (EDU) session. Self-report measures included the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), and the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ) including two subscales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search. Salivary cortisol levels were collected by the subjects in their homes at the time of awakening, 30 and 45 min after awakening, and at 12.00, 17.00, and 21.00 h. Measurement time points include baseline, the 2nd month (completion of BMS therapy), the 5th month, and the 8th month. Results: There were no significant differences in BDI-II scores (p{\textgreater}0.05) and MLQ-Presence scores (p {\textgreater}0.05) between BMS and EDU groups at baseline or across the three follow-ups. Nevertheless, greater MLQ-Search scores were found in the BMS group compared to the EDU group during the 5th month of follow-up (p Conclusion: BMS group therapy likely contributed to enhancing an active search for meaning in life toward more opportunities for personal growth and to maintaining stable cortisol responses to everyday life stress for breast cancer survivors.},

abstract = {Background: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) therapy is a meditation therapy, though originally designed for stress management, it is being used for treating a variety of illnesses such as depression, anxiety, chronic pain, cancer, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, skin and immune disorders. Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to determine the efficacy of MBSR in the treatment of chronic illnesses; it's mechanism of action and adverse effects. It describes an alternative method of treatment for physicians and patients that may help patients cope with their diseases in a more effective way. Materials and Methods: COCHRANE, EMBASE and MEDLINE were systematically searched for data on outcome of treatment with MBSR used alone or in conjunction with other treatments. The data available on prevention of diseases through MBSR was also analyzed. Results: All the 18 studies included in this systematic review showed improvement in the condition of patients after MBSR therapy. These studies were focused on patients with chronic diseases like cancer, hypertension, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, chronic pain and skin disorders, before and after MBSR therapy. Conclusions: Although the research on MBSR is sparse, the results of these researches indicate that MBSR improves the condition of patients suffering from chronic illnesses and helps them cope with a wide variety of clinical problems.},

However, in this article we argue that computational modeling can provide insights into the mechanisms by which meditation produces its effects on cognition. Moreover, computational modeling allows the researcher to make predictions about how effects of meditation will generalize to other contexts such as other tasks, which can be tested in subsequent experiments. In addition, computational theories can help to clarify similarities and differences between meditation practices, which is crucial for mapping out the space of contemplative practices. In short, even though computational modeling has not yet been used extensively, we think this approach can make important contributions to the field of meditation research.},

abstract = {Secondary use of electronic health records (EHRs) promises to advance clinical research and better inform clinical decision making. Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name "deep patient". We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.},

abstract = {Objective This is a review of spiritually based interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction) that utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought to examine the evidence regarding relationships between spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer survivors. Methods A systematic search of 9 online databases was conducted for articles of original research, peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer selected questions regarding relationships between psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized in spiritually based interventions. Implications for future spiritually based interventions in breast cancer survivorship are discussed. Results Twenty-two articles were reviewed. Cortisol was the most common PNI biomarker outcome studied. Compared with control groups, intervention groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although limitations exist. Design methods have improved with regard to increased use of comparison groups compared with previous reviews. There are few spiritually based interventions that specifically measure religious or spiritual constructs. Similarly, there are few existing studies that utilize standardized religious or spiritual measures with PNI outcome measures. Findings suggest that a body of knowledge now exists in support of interventions with mindfulness-breathing-stretching components; furthermore, these interventions appear to offer potential improvement or stabilization of neuroendocrine-immune activity in breast cancer survivors compared to control groups. Conclusion From a PNI perspective, future spiritually based interventions should include standardized measures of religiousness and spirituality in order to understand relationships between and among religiousness, spirituality, and neuroendocrine-immune outcomes. Future research should now focus on determining the minimum dose and duration needed to improve or stabilize neuroendocrine-immune function, as well as diverse setting needs, including home-based practice for survivors who are too ill to travel to group sessions or lack economic resources.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In the last two decades, some of the neuroanatomical and  neurophysiological substrates of the placebo effect have been elucidated. What has emerged is the multifactorial nature of the placebo effect, such that there is not a single placebo effect but many. Here we report on recent advances in our understanding of this phenomenon, with particular emphasis on its use as an experimental model to better clarify different brain mechanisms. RECENT FINDINGS: One of the most interesting findings in the past few years is that the placebo effect is a learning phenomenon, which is powerfully influenced by the manipulation of different variables. The involvement of opioid mechanisms is supported by several studies on pain, but also by the exploration of new fields such as memory and cognition. Nonopioid mechanisms have been described as well, for example, in pain, Parkinson's disease and anxiety. Recent evidence confirms and extends previous findings on the key role of prefrontal regions in the placebo response. SUMMARY: The study of the placebo effect is paying dividends and bodes well for the future. Whereas in clinical practice it can increase the efficacy of a therapy, in the experimental setting it represents an excellent tool for neuroscience.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer experience psychological distress, accompanied by reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) and altered levels of cytokines, which may compromise cancer control. Few studies have evaluated psycho-immune outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in comparison to an active control condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether MBSR benefits psychological, behavioral, and immunological function in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: After confirmation of breast cancer staging, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (n = 192) were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or an 8-week active control condition (ACC). The ACC consisted of a series of cancer recovery and health education classes. Both MBSR and the ACC were administered in group format. METHODS: Women completed psychometric instruments and provided blood for NKCA and cytokine levels at pre-, mid-, and completion of program, as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. One hundred and twenty four women completed all five-assessments (MBSR, n = 63; ACC, n = 61). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze trajectories of outcomes over time and between groups. RESULTS: Compared to the ACC group, women randomized to MBSR exhibited decreasing trajectories of perceived stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms. Further, compared to women randomized to ACC, MBSR women exhibited trajectories demonstrating significantly more rapid restoration of NKCA, accompanied by lower circulating TNF-alpha levels, lower IL-6 production, and greater IFN-gamma production. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate early provision of MBSR for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer provides not only psychological benefit, but also optimizes immune function supportive of cancer control.},

It also aims to examine and compare the concepts of UPSR with self-compassion and its relation to mental well-being. Design: Correlation survey design validations of the UPSR scale (Patterson {\&} Joseph, 2006). Methods: The validation was conducted using an undergraduate and postgraduate student opportunity sample, n = 179. Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach's coefficient alpha and inter-item correlations. Convergent and divergent validity was explored in terms of correlations with self-compassion, depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scales. Results: There was good internal consistency for both the UPSR scale and the self-regard subscale and somewhat questionable internal consistency for the conditionality subscale. Overall the scale appears to be relatively consistent, supporting the previous findings reported by Patterson {\&} Joseph (2006). The results supported the hypothesis that UPSR is positively correlated with a measure of self-compassion and negatively correlated with measures of depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7). Conclusions: The UPSR scale is a valid measure of the person-centred concept of unconditional positive self-regard. This supports the potential use of the UPSR scale for evaluating therapeutic change for client-centred practitioners through the use of this non-medicalized tool.},

abstract = {Although placebos have long been considered a nuisance in clinical research, today they represent an active and productive field of research and, because of the involvement of many mechanisms, the study of the placebo effect can actually be viewed as a melting pot of concepts and ideas for neuroscience. Indeed, there exists not a single but many placebo effects, with different mechanisms and in different systems, medical conditions, and therapeutic interventions. For example, brain mechanisms of expectation, anxiety, and reward are all involved, as well as a variety of learning phenomena, such as Pavlovian conditioning, cognitive, and social learning. There is also some experimental evidence of different genetic variants in placebo responsiveness. The most productive models to better understand the neurobiology of the placebo effect are pain and Parkinson's disease. In these medical conditions, the neural networks that are involved have been identified: that is, the opioidergic-cholecystokinergic-dopaminergic modulatory network in pain and part of the basal ganglia circuitry in Parkinson's disease. Important clinical implications emerge from these recent advances in placebo research. First, as the placebo effect is basically a psychosocial context effect, these data indicate that different social stimuli, such as words and rituals of the therapeutic act, may change the chemistry and circuitry of the patient's brain. Second, the mechanisms that are activated by placebos are the same as those activated by drugs, which suggests a cognitive/affective interference with drug action. Third, if prefrontal functioning is impaired, placebo responses are reduced or totally lacking, as occurs in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. {\textcopyright} 2011 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The neural mechanisms whereby placebo conditioning leads to placebo analgesia remain unclear. In this study we aimed to identify the brain structures activated during placebo conditioning and subsequent placebo analgesia. We induced placebo analgesia by associating a sham treatment with pain reduction and used fMRI to measure brain activity associated with three stages of the placebo response: before, during and after the sham treatment, while participants anticipated and experienced brief laser pain. In the control session participants were explicitly told that the treatment was inactive. The sham treatment group reported a significant reduction in pain rating (p = 0.012). Anticipatory brain activity was modulated during placebo conditioning in a fronto-cingulate network involving the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), medial frontal cortex and the anterior mid-cingulate cortex (aMCC). Identical areas were modulated during anticipation in the placebo analgesia phase with the addition of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). However, during altered pain experience only aMCC, post-central gyrus and posterior cingulate demonstrated altered activity. The common frontal cortical areas modulated during anticipation in both the placebo conditioning and placebo analgesia phases have previously been implicated in placebo analgesia. Our results suggest that the main effect of placebo arises from the reduction of anticipation of pain during placebo conditioning that is subsequently maintained during placebo analgesia. {\textcopyright} 2009 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

In line with behavioral data that show decreased pain responses under placebo, pain-related activity in the spinal cord is strongly reduced under placebo. These results provide direct evidence for spinal inhibition as one mechanism of placebo analgesia and highlight that psychological factors can act on the earliest stages of pain processing in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {Recent research in functional genomics shows that social stressors affect the expression of immune response genes. These effects are mediated in part via our adaptive capacity for intracellular molecules to respond to extracellular signals, a process called signal transduction. Under this framework, one-way stressors can be transduced into cellular changes is through central nervous system (CNS) modulation of peripheral neural, endocrine, and molecular activity. Mindfulness meditation is a consciousness discipline used to cultivate attention and self-regulation, and may thus be relevant to the signal transduction process outlined in the social genomics literature. In this opinion article, we briefly review results from existing controlled trials that test the effects of mindfulness meditation on gene expression. We then speculate on a mind-body conceptual model, grounded in existing social genomics theory. In the spirit of hypothesis generation, we argue that mindfulness meditation changes brain activity patterns related to attention, self-regulation, and threat evaluation and so may alter the signal transduction process that regulates the expression of immune response genes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The significance of mindfulness meditation (MM) has increased in recent years in both clinical settings and public health. However, ways to implement MM as a disease prevention or treatment method in the elderly is still a major challenge. A comprehensive analysis of previous studies on MM programs for the elderly in Korea will help build future integrated care programs that incorporate MM. METHODS: Seven international and Korean domestic electronic databases were searched to collect relevant clinical studies until May 30, 2020. RESULTS: Sixteen articles with twelve clinical studies were included in this review. The MM program was generally offered once a week over eight weeks with a duration of between 60 and 90 min per session. The main reason for participants' drop out was poor program compliance attributed to conflicting schedules, physical illness, or a change of mind. The program results were either positive or mixed, but the mindfulness level of the participants was improved. CONCLUSIONS: This review summarizes information obtained from previously published studies in Korea, on the design considerations, characteristics, and preliminary effectiveness of the MM program for the elderly. The findings can be used as preliminary data by future practitioners and/or researchers to design MM programs targeted toward the elderly; it could also help policymakers integrate MM-based strategies into integrated care programs to promote their mental health and well-being.},

abstract = {With the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, existing antibiotics are losing their potency. Antimicrobial peptides (AmPs) represent an exciting class of drug candidates, particularly because their mechanism of action is unlikely to induce drug resistance. If resistance to AmPs were also slower to emerge in the clinic, they would have longer useful lifetimes than existing antibiotics. Nevertheless, a number of limitations exist for AmPs in the clinic. The high cost of peptide manufacture requires that highly potent sequences are created. Additionally, AmP selectivity must be improved if effective systemic doses are to be given without hemolytic activity or other toxicity. Improved high-throughput methods for AmP design or discovery could enable the achievement of both of these goals. To this end, we developed an approach based on the discovery of semi-conserved motifs across natural AmPs, which we demonstrated are associated with antimicrobial activity. Additionally, we created novel AmP formulations that may bypass some of these clinical limitations. In order to evaluate AmP design approaches, a high-throughput production and assay platform was created using in vitro translation. This technology may produce peptides that would be toxic to recombinant hosts and synthesize peptides of arbitrary length. The cost per peptide was minimized through a series of process improvements. First, we created methods to construct oligonucleotides that mimicked our motif-based design of AmPs. This approach allowed the reuse of primers for many peptides, reducing cost and enabling the study of pattern synergy. Additionally, we found peptide translation was enhanced by co-translating a fusion partner in frame with the AmP. The AmP could be freed from the fusion partner after translation using enterokinase digestion. Further, we increased yield 3-fold by optimizing the length of fusion partner. The partner was made as short as possible to limit the translational resources required to synthesize the fusion partner, while being long enough to ensure stability from proteases. The solubility of the fusion partner-AmP construct was also improved through the selection of a highly soluble partner of the optimal length. Finally, we developed a purification scheme to ensure that the in vitro translation extract would not impact measurement of antimicrobial activity. We also developed and evaluated the design of AmPs using semi-conserved motifs. We used a database of over 500 natural AmPs as a training set for pattern},

This task is complicated by data sources that are noisy, sparse, heterogeneous and outcomes that are imbalanced. In this paper, we integrate data from all available ICU sources (vitals, labs, notes, demographics) and focus on learning rich representations of this data to predict onset and weaning of multiple invasive interventions. In particular, we compare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable "real-time" performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results on our predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines in intervention prediction, and provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for the adoption of such models in practice.},

abstract = {A single head and neck Cancer (HNC) is a globally growing challenge associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The diagnosis itself can affect the patients profoundly let alone the complex and disfiguring treatment. The highly important functions of structures of the head and neck such as mastication, speech, aesthetics, identity and social interactions make a cancer diagnosis in this region even more psychologically traumatic. The emotional distress engendered as a result of functional and social disruption is certain to negatively affect health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The key biological responses to stressful events are moderated through the combined action of two systems, the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA) which releases glucocorticoids and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) which releases catecholamines. In acute stress, these hormones help the body to regain homeostasis; however, in chronic stress their increased levels and activation of their receptors may aid in the progression of cancer. Despite ample evidence on the existence of stress in patients diagnosed with HNC, studies looking at the effect of stress on the progression of disease are scarce, compared to other cancers. This review summarises the challenges associated with HNC that make it stressful and describes how stress signalling aids in the progression of cancer. Growing evidence on the relationship between stress and HNC makes it paramount to focus future research towards a better understanding of stress and its effect on head and neck cancer.},

abstract = {This research examined self-compassion and self-esteem as they relate to various aspects of psychological functioning. Self-compassion entails treating oneself with kindness, recognizing one's shared humanity, and being mindful when considering negative aspects of oneself. Study 1 (N=2,187) compared self-compassion and global self-esteem as they relate to ego-focused reactivity. It was found that self-compassion predicted more stable feelings of self-worth than self-esteem and was less contingent on particular outcomes. Self-compassion also had a stronger negative association with social comparison, public self-consciousness, self-rumination, anger, and need for cognitive closure. Self-esteem (but not self-compassion) was positively associated with narcissism. Study 2 (N=165) compared global self-esteem and self-compassion with regard to positive mood states. It was found that the two constructs were statistically equivalent predictors of happiness, optimism, and positive affect. Results from these two studies suggest that self-compassion may be a useful alternative to global self-esteem when considering what constitutes a healthy self-stance. {\textcopyright} 2009, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies show that stress-related processes can impact pathways implicated in cancer progression, including immunoregulation, angiogenesis, and invasion. Contributions of systemic factors, such as stress hormones to the crosstalk between tumor and stromal cells, appear to be critical in modulating downstream signaling pathways with important implications for disease progression. Inflammatory pathways may also be implicated in fatigue and other factors related to quality of life. Although substantial evidence supports a positive effect of psychosocial interventions on quality of life in cancer, the clinical evidence for efficacy of stress-modulating psychosocial interventions in slowing cancer progression remains inconclusive, and the biobehavioral mechanisms that might explain such effects are still being established.

abstract = {The objective of this study was to articulate the person-centered approach (PCAp) in theory and in the research and practice of occupational mental health. First, Carl Rogers' person-centered theory was reviewed. Secondly, a study on 1,661 workers was presented in which psychological variables such as fatigue (FG), depression (DP) and anxiety (AX) were found to be negatively correlated with relationship scales concerning the workers' perception of the person-centered attitudes (PCA) of their superiors, the democratic leadership of their superiors (DEM) and the overall activation (ACT) of their worksites. Significant differences in FG, DP and AX were found among workers who perceived of their superiors as having either high or low PCA. Workers who reported that their superiors had high PCA had significantly less FG, DP and AX than those who perceived of their superiors as having low PCA. Similar results were also obtained when high DEM/low DEM and high ACT/low ACT were compared in terms of workers' FG, DP and AX. Thus, the PCA of job superiors was considered to be positively related to the mental health of workers. Thirdly, PCA training in industry was introduced and evaluated. A total of 137 trainees (managers) conducted active listening, a basic skill in the PCAp, and filled out a relationship inventory immediately afterwards, evaluating themselves as listeners and their partners as listeners. A comparison of scores between the first and last sessions of training showed significant increases in empathy, congruence and unconditional positive regard at the last session in both the speakers' version and the listeners' version of the relationship inventory. Cases showing changes in human relations at work as a consequence of PCA training, reported by the trainees and confirmed by an occupational health nurse, were presented. This study showed that PCA, which is positively related to workers' mental health, can increase as a result of training. The implications of these studies are discussed and various possibilities for further research using the concepts of PCAp are presented. The authors hope that such a viewpoint in occupational mental health may lead to fruitful research and practice in the field of occupational medicine. {\textcopyright} 1992, Japan Society for Occupational Health.

abstract = {REVIEW QUESTION/OBJECTIVE: The objective of this review is to identify the effectiveness of mindfulness based programs in reducing stress experienced by nurses in adult hospitalized patient care settings. BACKGROUND: Nursing professionals face extraordinary stressors in the medical environment. Many of these stressors have always been inherent to the profession: long work hours, dealing with pain, loss and emotional suffering, caring for dying patients and providing support to families. Recently nurses have been experiencing increased stress related to other factors such as staffing shortages, increasingly complex patients, corporate financial constraints and the increased need for knowledge of ever-changing technology. Stress affects high-level cognitive functions, specifically attention and memory, and this increases the already high stakes for nurses. Nurses are required to cope with very difficult situations that require accurate, timely decisions that affect human lives on a daily basis.Lapses in attention increase the risk of serious consequences such as medication errors, failure to recognize life-threatening signs and symptoms, and other essential patient safety issues. Research has also shown that the stress inherent to health care occupations can lead to depression, reduced job satisfaction, psychological distress and disruptions to personal relationships. These outcomes of stress are factors that create scenarios for risk of patient harm.There are three main effects of stress on nurses: burnout, depression and lateral violence. Burnout has been defined as a syndrome of depersonalization, emotional exhaustion, and a sense of low personal accomplishment, and the occurrence of burnout has been closely linked to perceived stress. Shimizu, Mizoue, Mishima and Nagata state that nurses experience considerable job stress which has been a major factor in the high rates of burnout that has been recorded among nurses. Zangaro and Soeken share this opinion and state that work related stress is largely contributing to the current nursing shortage. They report that work stress leads to a much higher turnover, especially during the first year after graduation, lowering retention rates in general.In a study conducted in Pennsylvania, researchers found that while 43{\%} of the nurses who reported high levels of burnout indicated their intent to leave their current position, only 11{\%} of nurses who were not burned out intended to leave in the following 12 months. In the same study patient-to-nurse ratios were significantly associated with emotional exhaustion and burnout. An increase of one patient per nurse assignment to a hospital's staffing level increased burnout by 23{\%}.Depression can be defined as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. Wang found that high levels of work stress were associated with higher risk of mood and anxiety disorders. In Canada one out of every 10 nurses have shown depressive symptoms; compared to the average of 5.1{\%} of the nurses' counterparts who do not work in healthcare. High incidences of depression and depressive symptoms were also reported in studies among Chinese nurses (38{\%}) and Taiwanese nurses (27.7{\%}). In the Taiwanese study the occurrence of depression was significantly and positively correlated to job stress experienced by the nurses (p{\textless}0.001).In a multivariate logistic regression, Ohler, Kerr and Forbes also found that job stress was significantly correlated to depression in nurses. The researchers reported that nurses who experienced a higher degree of job stress were 80{\%} more likely to have suffered a major depressive episode in the previous year. A further finding in this study revealed that 75{\%} of the participants also suffered from at least one chronic disease revealing a strong association between depression and other major health issues.A stressful working environment, such as a hospital, could potentially lead to lateral violence among nurses. Lateral violence is a serious occupational health concern among nurses as evidenced by extensive research and literature available on the topic. The impact of lateral violence has been well studied and documented over the past three decades. Griffin and Clark state that lateral violence is a form of bullying grounded in the theoretical framework of the oppression theory. The bullying behaviors occur among members of an oppressed group as a result of feeling powerless and having a perceived lack of control in their workplace. Griffin identified the ten most common forms of lateral violence among nurses as "non-verbal innuendo, verbal affront, undermining activities, withholding information, sabotage, infighting, scape-goating, backstabbing, failure to respect privacy, and broken confidences". Nurse-to-nurse lateral violence leads to negative workplace relationships and disrupts team performance, creating an environment where poor patient outcomes, burnout and high staff turnover rates are prevalent.Work-related stressors have been indicated as a potential cause of lateral violence. According to the Effort Reward Imbalance model (ERI) developed by Siegrist, work stress develops when an imbalance exists between the effort individuals put into their jobs and the rewards they receive in return. The ERI model has been widely used in occupational health settings based on its predictive power for adverse health and well-being outcomes. The model claims that both high efforts with low rewards could lead to negative emotions in the exposed employees. Vegchel, van Jonge, de Bosma {\&} Schaufeli state that, according to the ERI model, occupational rewards mostly consist of money, esteem and job security or career opportunities. A survey conducted by Reineck {\&} Furino indicated that registered nurses had a very high regard for the intrinsic rewards of their profession but that they identified workplace relationships and stress issues as some of the most important contributors to their frustration and exhaustion. Hauge, Skogstad {\&} Einarsen state that work-related stress further increases the potential for lateral violence as it creates a negative environment for both the target and the perpetrator.Mindfulness based programs have proven to be a promising intervention in reducing stress experienced by nurses. Mindfulness was originally defined by Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 as "paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally, to the unfolding of experience moment to moment". The Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program is an educationally based program that focuses on training in the contemplative practice of mindfulness. It is an eight-week program where participants meet weekly for two-and-a-half hours and join a one-day long retreat for six hours. The program incorporates a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness and yoga to help increase mindfulness in participants. The practice is meant to facilitate relaxation in the body and calming of the mind by focusing on present-moment awareness. The program has proven to be effective in reducing stress, improving quality of life and increasing self-compassion in healthcare professionals.Researchers have demonstrated that mindfulness interventions can effectively reduce stress, anxiety and depression in both clinical and non-clinical populations. In a meta-analysis of seven studies conducted with healthy participants from the general public, the reviewers reported a significant reduction in stress when the treatment and control groups were compared. However, there have been limited studies to date that focused specifically on the effectiveness of mindfulness programs to reduce stress experienced by nurses.In addition to stress reduction, mindfulness based interventions can also enhance nurses' capacity for focused attention and concentration by increasing present moment awareness. Mindfulness techniques can be applied in everyday situations as well as stressful situations. According to Kabat-Zinn, work-related stress influences people differently based on their viewpoint and their interpretation of the situation. He states that individuals need to be able to see the whole picture, have perspective on the connectivity of all things and not operate on automatic pilot to effectively cope with stress. The goal of mindfulness meditation is to empower individuals to respond to situations consciously rather than automatically.Prior to the commencement of this systematic review, the Cochrane Library and JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports were searched. No previous systematic reviews on the topic of reducing stress experienced by nurses through mindfulness programs were identified. Hence, the objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the best research evidence available pertaining to mindfulness-based programs and their effectiveness in reducing perceived stress among nurses.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {(In writing this paper I have drawn heavily on two previous articles of mine, separated by a number of years; Rogers (1963, 1978)). I wish to point to two related tendencies which have acquired more and more importance in my thinking as the years have gone by. One of these is an actualising tendency, a characteristic of organic life. One is a formative tendency in the universe as a whole. Taken together they are, I believe, the foundation blocks of the person-centered approach. Its Characteristics But what do I mean by a person-centered approach? For me it expresses the primary theme of my whole professional life, as that theme has become clarified through experience, interaction with others, and research. I smile as I think of the various labels I have given to this theme during the course of my career -nondirective counselling, client-centered therapy, student-centered teaching, group-centered leadership. As the fields of application have grown in number and variety, the label "person-centered approach" seems the most descriptive. The central hypothesis of this approach can be briefly stated. (See Rogers, 1959, for a complete statement.) It is that the individual has within him or herself vast resources for self-understanding, for altering the self-concept basic attitudes, and his or her self-directed behaviour -and that these resources can be tapped if only a definable climate of facilitative psychological attitudes can be provided.},
annote = {When I am at my best, as a group facilitator or a therapist, I discover another characteristic. I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then whatever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful. There is nothing I can do to force this experience, but when I can relax and be close to the transcendental core of me, then I may behave in strange and impulsive ways in the relationship, ways which I cannot justify rationally, which have nothing to do with my thought processes. But these strange behaviours turn out to be right, in some odd way. At those moments it seems that my inner spirit has reached out and touched the inner spirit of the other. Our relationship transcends itself, and has become a part of something larger. Profound growth and healing and energy are present.

abstract = {A broad range of mind-body therapies (MBTs) are used by the public today, and a growing body of clinical and basic sciences research has resulted in evidence-based integration of many MBTs into clinical practice. Basic sciences research has identified some of the physiological correlates of MBT practices, leading to a better understanding of the processes by which emotional, cognitive and psychosocial factors can influence health outcomes and well-being. In particular, results from functional genomics and neuroimaging describe some of the processes involved in the mind-body connection and how these can influence health outcomes. Functional genomic and neurophysiological correlates of MBTs are reviewed, detailing studies showing changes in sympathetic nervous system activation of gene transcription factors involved in immune function and inflammation, electroencephalographic and neuroimaging studies on MBT practices, and persistent changes in neural function and morphology associated with these practices. While the broad diversity of study designs and MBTs studied presents a patchwork of results requiring further validation through replication and longitudinal studies, clear themes emerge for MBTs as immunomodulatory, with effects on leukocyte transcription and function related to inflammatory and innate immune responses, and neuromodulatory, with effects on brain function and morphology relevant for attention, learning, and emotion regulation. By detailing the potential mechanisms of action by which MBTs may influence health outcomes, the data generated by these studies have contributed significantly towards a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying MBTs.},

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been associated with pain regulation and with the generation, maintenance and manipulation of cognitive representations, consistent with its role in expectation. In a heat-pain paradigm, we employed non-invasive low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to transiently disrupt left and right DLPFC function or used the TMS device itself as a placebo, before applying an expectation-induced placebo analgesia. The results demonstrated that placebo significantly increased pain threshold and pain tolerance. While rTMS did not affect pain experience, it completely blocked placebo analgesia.

abstract = {Background: Adverse psychosocial exposures in early life, namely experiences such as child maltreatment, caregiver stress or depression, and domestic or community violence, have been associated in epidemiological studies with increased lifetime risk of adverse outcomes, including diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and psychiatric illnesses. Additional work has shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms by which early adversity becomes "biologically embedded" in altered physiology across body systems. This review surveys evidence on such mechanisms and calls on researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and other practitioners to act upon evidence. Observations: Childhood psychosocial adversity has wide-ranging effects on neural, endocrine, immune, and metabolic physiology. Molecular mechanisms broadly implicate disruption of central neural networks, neuroendocrine stress dysregulation, and chronic inflammation, among other changes. Physiological disruption predisposes individuals to common diseases across the life course. Conclusions: Reviewed evidence has important implications for clinical practice, biomedical research, and work across other sectors relevant to public health and child wellbeing. Warranted changes include increased clinical screening for exposures among children and adults, scale-up of effective interventions, policy advocacy, and ongoing research to develop new evidence-based response strategies.},

abstract = {Stress-induced immune dysregulation results in significant health consequences for immune related disorders including viral infections, chronic autoimmune disease, and tumor growth and metastasis. In this mini-review we discuss the sympathetic, neuroendocrine and immunologic mechanisms by which psychosocial stress can impact cancer biology. Both human and animal studies have shown the sympathetic and neuroendocrine responses to psychosocial stress significantly impacts cancer, in part, through regulation of inflammatory mediators. Psychosocial stressors stimulate neuroendocrine, sympathetic, and immune responses that result in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the subsequent regulation of inflammatory responses by immune cells. Social disruption (SDR) stress, a murine model of psychosocial stress and repeated social defeat, provides a novel and powerful tool to probe the mechanisms leading to stress-induced alterations in inflammation, tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. In this review, we will focus on SDR as an important model of psychosocial stress in understanding neural-immune mechanisms in cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The aim of this research is to explore the metastasis associated negative effect of chronic stress. The analysis of transcriptome sequencing implied that activation of STAT3 signaling pathway by downregulated miR-337-3p might be a potential mechanism to induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cell and promote metastasis under chronic stress. We also verified this biological process in further experiments. Downregulation of miR-337-3p could downregulate E-cadherin expression and upregulate vimentin expression in vitro and in vivo. STAT3, related signal pathways of which are involved in metastasis regulation, was directly targeted by miR-337-3p. In conclusion, the above results denoted that activation of miR-337-3p/STAT3 axis might be a potential pathway for the increasing metastasis of breast cancer under chronic stress.},

abstract = {Aims: Chronic stress plays an important role in promoting the progression and migration of cancers. However, little is known of any direct impact on tumor progression related to the regulation of emotion-related circuitry. The aim of this study was to explore the neural-circuit mechanisms underlying stress-induced progression of cancers and the impact of emotion-related regulation of circuitry on tumor growth. Methods: Optogenetic manipulation was applied to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS)–treated mice bearing breast tumor cell. The stress-related hormones, tumor-related cytokines, the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)–positive neurons and their fibers, dopamine receptor–positive cells, and anxiety level were measured using ELISA, immunohistochemical staining, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and behavioral test, respectively. Results: By investigating breast cancer mouse models with a chronic mild stress model, optogenetic stimulation, and behavioral analysis, we show that chronic stress induced anxiety-like behavior in mice and increased serum concentration of norepinephrine and corticosterone, hormones closely related to stress and anxiety. Optogenetic activation of VTA TH terminals in the mPFC rescued anxiety-like behavior induced by chronic stress. Chronic stress resulted in marked progression of breast tumors, and repetitive optogenetic activation of VTA TH terminals in the mPFC significantly attenuated stress-induced progression of breast cancers and reduced serum concentration of norepinephrine and corticosterone. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between serum norepinephrine or corticosterone concentration and tumor size. Conclusions: These findings indicate a positive role of an emotion regulation circuit on the progression of breast cancer and reveal a link between stress, emotion regulation, and the progression of breast cancers. Our findings provide new insights pertinent to therapeutic interventions in the treatment of breast cancers.},

abstract = {As a person with hemophilia (PWH), my passion led me to conduct personal research to uncover the main cause of my drawbacks in my education, my career, and my romantic life. I have experienced unjustified conflicts in my social relations, feeling stale in mind and body, indefinite self-image, emotional instability, and successive spontaneous bleeds despite the continuous factor replacement. My research is based on my experience of living with hemophilia for 37 years, reading countless books on personal development and the mind-body relationship, and having profound discussions about these experiences with my wife. Findings: Through my research, I uncovered that I used to suffer from what I call 'mind inhibitors' these were the hidden cause of my life disorders and spontaneous bleeds. These mind inhibitors are responsible for locking the body factor receptors, blocking body energy centres (like the solar plexus), discouraging the super-intelligent body cells from running their auto-healing system, and paralyzing the instinctive high-speed cellular response to external molecular treatment. Mind inhibitors originate from different sources like thinking of oneself in a victim role, anxiety about medical treatments, lack of financial stability, negative attitudes, self-rejection, and contradictory thoughts and feelings. Conclusion: Mind inhibitors should be handled as seriously as biological inhibitors. As Dr. Bruce Lipton explains in his book, 'The Biology of Belief': DNA does not control our biology; instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell. Our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking, since thoughts are made of energy that affects the cellular energy level, and thus everything is created twice: once in our minds and then the physical creation follows. New holistic approaches should be considered for treating PWH as a complete synchronized system of Soul, Mind, and Body; treatment should include more than just factor adjustment. Factor adjustment only treats symptoms, but a holistic approach would also address the patient's need for a subconscious paradigm shift in the person's thought and belief system.},

@inproceedings{Ling-ChengMong2021,
abstract = {Background and Aims One of the significant proportions in delivering holistic healthcare in dental practice is spiritual care. World Health Organisation has called worldwide for delivering person-centred care from the physical, emotional, socio-economic and spiritual perspectives. However, there were limited literature and strategies for spiritual care delivery in dental practice. We aim to provide 12 tips to integrate spiritual care delivery strategies and techniques for dental educators according to the spiritual care theory developed by Schweitzer Christian and Missionary Alliance (SCMA). Methods The tips, using the grounded theory technique, were constructed with the reflective observations of the experienced clinician- educators and the literature review of applying the framework of spiritual care theory and person-centred learning in dental education and practice. Results The 12 tips for the dental educators training learners about performing spiritual care in dentistry are respectively addressed: 1) Delivering prior knowledge of the spiritual care theory before/during the early clinical exposure. 2) Systematically integrating the spiritual care assessment and pathological examination when delivering the training of pathological assessments. 3) Being mindful to patient's mental health and emotional changes during the dental care. 4) Taking patient's socioeconomic statement thoroughly for building a holistic consideration. 5) Patent's supporting system is essential for the spiritual care. 6) Being aware of dental interventions could affect patient's self-image and values. 7) Patient's history of illness could affect the approaches of spiritual care in dentistry. 8) Learning to listen proactively 9) Therapeutic relationship is an essential key towards spiritual care. 10) Instructing passive aggressively. 11) Being aware of patient's spiritual needs during/after treatment. 12) Applying the holistic healthcare strategies, such as the Shared Decision Marking, to collect more spiritual-related information of patients in the treating process and adjusting the approaches dynamically. Conclusion The 12 tips presented effectively offer specific coaching strategies to engage trainers, enlarge their clinical perspectives and enhance the effectiveness of the trainers' coaching efficacy when delivering spiritual care training in dental practice. This paper contributes to regulate and establish the particular inter-disciplinary training strategies for providing spiritual care during the dental care in practice.},

@article{Chida2008,
abstract = {A substantial body of research has investigated the associations between  stress-related psychosocial factors and cancer outcomes. Previous narrative reviews have been inconclusive. In this Review, we evaluated longitudinal associations between stress and cancer using meta-analytic methods. The results of 165 studies indicate that stress-related psychosocial factors are associated with higher cancer incidence in initially healthy populations (P = 0.005); in addition, poorer survival in patients with diagnosed cancer was noted in 330 studies (P {\textless}0.001), and higher cancer mortality was seen in 53 studies (P {\textless}0.001). Subgroup meta-analyses demonstrate that stressful life experiences are related to poorer cancer survival and higher mortality but not to an increased incidence. Stress-prone personality or unfavorable coping styles and negative emotional responses or poor quality of life were related to higher cancer incidence, poorer cancer survival and higher cancer mortality. Site-specific analyses indicate that psychosocial factors are associated with a higher incidence of lung cancer and poorer survival in patients with breast, lung, head and neck, hepatobiliary, and lymphoid or hematopoietic cancers. These analyses suggest that stress-related psychosocial factors have an adverse effect on cancer incidence and survival, although there is evidence of publication bias and results should be interpreted with caution.},
