abstract = {The biggest challenge to improve the diagnosis and therapies of Craniomaxillofacial conditions is to translate algorithms and software developments towards the creation of holistic patient models. A complete picture of the individual patient for treatment planning and personalized healthcare requires a compilation of clinician-friendly algorithms to provide minimally invasive diagnostic techniques with multimodal image integration and analysis. We describe here the implementation of the open-source Craniomaxillofacial module of the 3D Slicer software, as well as its clinical applications. This paper proposes data management approaches for multisource data extraction, registration, visualization, and quantification. These applications integrate medical images with clinical and biological data analytics, user studies, and other heterogeneous data.},

abstract = {This systematic review aimed to evaluate the use of three-dimensional (3D) printed bone models for training, simulating and/or planning interventions in oral and cranio-maxillofacial surgery. A systematic search was conducted using PubMed{\textregistered} and SCOPUS{\textregistered} databases, up to March 10, 2019, by following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol. Study selection, quality assessment (modified Critical Appraisal Skills Program tool) and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. All original full papers written in English/French/Italian and dealing with the fabrication of 3D printed models of head bone structures, designed from 3D radiological data were included. Multiple parameters and data were investigated, such as author's purpose, data acquisition systems, printing technologies and materials, accuracy, haptic feedback, variations in treatment time, differences in clinical outcomes, costs, production time and cost-effectiveness. Among the 1157 retrieved abstracts, only 69 met the inclusion criteria. 3D printed bone models were mainly used as training or simulation models for tumor removal, or bone reconstruction. Material jetting printers showed best performance but the highest cost. Stereolithographic, laser sintering and binder jetting printers allowed to create accurate models with adequate haptic feedback. The cheap fused deposition modeling printers exhibited satisfactory results for creating training models. Patient-specific 3D printed models are known to be useful surgical and educational tools. Faced with the large diversity of software, printing technologies and materials, the clinical team should invest in a 3D printer specifically adapted to the final application.},
