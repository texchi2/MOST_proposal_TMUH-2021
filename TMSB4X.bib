abstract = {We describe here the detection and identification of 13 primary metabolites (AMP, ADP, ATP, UDP-GlcNAc, ...) directly from rat brain sections by chemical mass spectrometry imaging. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS/MS) was combined with 9-aminoacridine as a powerful matrix. We also demonstrate that a new robotic sprayer allows us to homogeneously coat the surface with the matrix, enabling the acquisition of chemical images at a 50 microm resolution, leading us to precisely and simultaneously localize each metabolite over the tissue surface. These experiments open a new field of investigation for chemical mass spectrometry imaging and are of great interest for both chemists and biologists.},

abstract = {PURPOSE Histopathology is the standard approach for tissue diagnostics and centerpiece of pathology. Although the current system provides prognostic information, there is need for molecular markers that enhance diagnosis and better predict clinical prognosis. The ability to localize disease-specific molecular changes in biopsy tissue would help improve critical pathology decision making. Direct profiling of proteins from tissue using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry has the potential to supplement morphology with underlying molecular detail. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN A discovery set of 11 prostate cancer (PCa)-containing and 10 benign prostate tissue sections was evaluated for protein expression differences. A separate validation set of 54 tissue sections (23 PCa and 31 benign) was used to verify the results. Cryosectioning was done to yield tissue sections analyzed by a pathologist to determine tissue morphology and mirror sections for imaging mass spectrometry. Spectra were acquired and the intensity of signals was plotted as a function of the location within the tissue. RESULTS An expression profile was found that discriminates between PCa and normal tissue. The overexpression of a single ion at m/z 4,355 was able to discriminate cancer from uninvolved tissue. Tandem mass spectrometry identified this marker as a fragment of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 2 (MEKK2). The ability of MEKK2 to discriminate tumor from normal cells was orthogonally confirmed. CONCLUSIONS This study highlights the potential of this approach to uncover molecular detail that can be correlated with pathology decision making. In addition, the identification of MEKK2 shows the ability to discover proteins of relevance to PCa biology.},

abstract = {AIMS: We investigated whether actin-sequestering protein, thymosin beta-4 (TB4)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) affect the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1alpha and paclitaxel-resistance induction. MAIN METHODS: HeLa human cervical tumor cells were used. The percentage of cell survival was determined by MTT assay. ROS production, cell cycle and hypodiploid cell formation were assessed by flow cytometry analysis. HIF-1alpha stabilization and molecular changes were analyzed by western blotting or RT-PCR. NF-kappaB activation was assessed by EMSA and western blotting. KEY FINDINGS: TB4 protein (TB4P) significantly increased intracellular ROS level and HIF-1alpha. The increased level of HIF-1alpha by TB4P was reduced by the treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a well-known ROS scavenger. TB4P-induced ROS production was confirmed by the activation of nuclear factor kappa B. TB4P-induced Erk phosphorylation was attenuated by the treatment with NAC. In addition, tumor cell death was decreased by TB4 gene overexpression and TB4P treatment. NAC treatment attenuated tumor cell density increased by TB4P. Tumor cell death by paclitaxel was also increased by NAC treatment or the transfection with HIF-1alpha-siRNA. Paclitaxel-induced B16F10 mouse melanoma regression was physiologically inhibited in TB4-transgenic mice compared to wildtype mice. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate that TB4-induced ROS and ROS-mediated HIF-1alpha stabilization could play a role in tumor cell resistance to anticancer agents like paclitaxel. It suggests that soluble TB4 could be a novel endogenous regulator to control intracellular ROS production in tumor cells.},

abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. More than half of all CRC patients will develop metastases, which represents the major cause of death for CRC patients. CRC metastases confined in other organs are potentially resectable, and patients who receive curative resections appear to have better outcomes. Thus, the early detection of metastasis in CRC patients could improve their survival rate after curative surgery. Here, we report the use of Cy-dye labeling combined with multi-dimensional fractionation and mass spectrometry as a proteomics-based approach for identifying CRC metastasis-associated biomarker(s) in plasma samples collected from three CRC patients upon diagnosis of their primary and metastatic tumors. Among the eight identified proteins, we used Western blot analysis and an in-house-developed ELISA to validate the increased plasma levels of one, secretory (plasma) gelsolin, in {\textgreater}80{\%} of CRC patients with distal metastases in a larger sample cohort (32 patients). We also found a significant increase of secretory gelsolin in plasma samples of stage IV versus stages I-III CRC patients before treatment. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that secretory gelsolin was highly overexpressed in CRC tissue specimens compared to adjacent normal tissues, and a cell model study showed that secretory gelsolin may help regulate CRC cell migration.},

@article{Piludu2015,
abstract = {Due to its actin-sequestering properties, thymosin beta-4 (Tbeta4) is considered to play a significant role in the cellular metabolism. Several physiological properties of Tbeta4 have been reported;, however, many questions concerning its cellular function remain to be ascertained. To better understand the role of this small peptide we have analyzed by means of transmission immunoelectron microscopy techniques the ultrastructural localization of Tbeta4 in HepG2 cells. Samples of HepG2 cells were fixed in a mixture of 3{\%} formaldehyde and 0.1{\%} glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and processed for standard electron microscopic techniques. The samples were dehydrated in a cold graded methanol series and embedded in LR gold resin. Ultrathin sections were labeled with rabbit antibodies to Tbeta4, followed by gold-labeled goat anti-rabbit, stained with uranyl acetate and bismuth subnitrate, observed and photographed in a JEOL 100S transmission electron microscope. High-resolution electron microscopy showed that Tbeta4 was mainly restricted to the cytoplasm of HepG2 growing in complete medium. A strong Tbeta4 reactivity was detected in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasmic compartment where gold particles appeared strictly associated to the nuclear membrane. In the nucleus specific Tbeta4 labeling was observed in the nucleolus. The above electron microscopic results confirm and extend previous observations at light microscopic level, highlighting the subcellular distribution of Tbeta4 in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of HepG2 cells. The meaning of Tbeta4 presence in the nucleolus is not on the best of our knowledge clarified yet. It could account for the interaction of Tbeta4 with nucleolar actin and according with this hypothesis, Tbeta4 could contribute together with the other nucleolar acting binding proteins to modulate the transcription activity of the RNA polymerases.},

abstract = {Background: Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and has been considered to be highly associated with altered biological processes, including immunocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory response, angiogenesis, and/or immune regulation, suggesting that the levels of the tumor-related cytokines and chemokines will be dysregulated in the tumor microenvironment as well as in the systemic circulation and might be associated with some OSCC phenotypes. Methods: To profile cytokines in OSCC patients, the plasma levels of 48 proteins (26 cytokines, 10 chemokines, and 12 growth factors) were measured in 111 untreated OSCC patients, 112 healthy individuals, and 107 individuals with oral premalignant lesion (OPL). Result: Compared to the plasma levels in the healthy individuals and OPL group, the levels of 12 proteins were significantly dysregulated in the OSCC patients. Further analysis demonstrated that the levels of IFN-$\alpha$2, IL-2RA, and SCF were significantly lower in patients with higher pT status. IFN-$\alpha$2 levels also decreased in patients with higher tumor depths. Moreover, OSCC patients with greater levels of VEGF ({\textgreater} 4.87. pg/ml) before treatment had worse prognoses for overall survival after treatment (P= 0.035). Conclusions: This is the first report showing that the plasma VEGF levels may be a useful prognostic indicator of OSCC. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {Thymosin beta-4 (T$\beta$4), actin-sequestering protein, plays important roles in many cellular functions including cancer cell migrations. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) in Wnt signaling pathway is a key molecule to control intercellular interaction. Here, we investigated whether GSK-3 activity is regulated by T$\beta$4 and it is associated with T$\beta$4-mediated migration in gastric cancer cells. Various expression level of T$\beta$4 was observed in human gastric tumor tissues. Migration in gastric cancer cells, SNU638 and SNU668, was dependent on a relative expression level of T$\beta$4. Cell migration was higher in SNU668 with a higher expression level of T$\beta$4 than that in SNU638 with a lower T$\beta$4. Although the level of phosphorylated(p)-GSK-3$\alpha$ (inactive), $\beta$-catenin, E-cadherin and E-cadherin:$\beta$-catenin complex was relatively higher, p-GSK-3$\beta$ (inactive) was lower in SNU638 compared to those in SNU668 cells. LiCl, GSK-3$\alpha$/$\beta$ inhibitor, reduced lung metastasis of B16F10 mouse melanoma cells and SNU668 cell migration. Small interference (si)RNA of GSK-3$\alpha$ increased SNU638 cell migration in accordance with the reduction of E-cadherin:$\beta$-catenin complex formation through a decrease in $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin. Expression level of GSK-3$\alpha$/$\beta$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin in SNU668 and SNU638 was reversed by T$\beta$4-siRNA and by the treatment with acetylated-serine-aspartic acid-lysine-proline (SDKP) tetrapeptide of T$\beta$4, respectively. E-cadherin expression in SNU638 cells was decreased by $\beta$-catenin-siRNA. PD98059, MEK inhibitor, or U0126, ERK inhibitor, reduced SNU668 cell migration accompanying an increase in p-GSK-3$\alpha$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin. Taken together, data indicated that the expression of GSK-3$\alpha$, $\beta$-catenin and E-cadherin could be negatively regulated by T$\beta$4-induced ERK phosphorylation. It suggests that T$\beta$4 could be a novel regulator to control Wnt signaling pathways.},

abstract = {A veterinary preparation known as TB-500 and containing a synthetic version of the naturally occurring peptide LKKTETQ has emerged. The peptide segment 17LKKTETQ23 is the active site within the protein thymosin $\beta$4 responsible for actin binding, cell migration and wound healing. The key ingredient of TB-500 is the peptide LKKTETQ with artificial acetylation of the N-terminus. TB-500 is claimed to promote endothelial cell differentiation, angiogenesis in dermal tissues, keratinocyte migration, collagen deposition and decrease inflammation. In order to control the misuse of TB-500 in equine sports, a method to definitely identify its prior use in horses is required. This study describes a method for the simultaneous detection of N-acetylated LKKTETQ and its metabolites in equine urine and plasma samples. The possible metabolites of N-acetylated LKKTETQ were first identified from in vitro studies. The parent peptide and its metabolites were isolated from equine urine or plasma by solid-phase extraction using ion-exchange cartridges, and analysed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC/MS). These analytes were identified according to their LC retention times and relative abundances of the major product ions. The peptide N-acetylated LKKTETQ could be detected and confirmed at 0.02ng/mL in equine plasma and 0.01ng/mL in equine urine. This method was successful in confirming the presence of N-acetylated LKKTETQ and its metabolites in equine urine and plasma collected from horses administered with a single dose of TB-500 (containing 10mg of N-acetylated LKKTETQ). To our knowledge, this is the first identification of TB-500 and its metabolites in post-administration samples from horses.},

abstract = {Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) ranks among the most common cancer worldwide, and is associated with severe morbidity and high mortality. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF), characterized by fibrosis of the mucosa of the upper digestive tract, is a pre-malignant lesion, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this malignant transformation remains to be elucidated. In this study, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS)-based proteomic strategy was employed to profile the differentially expressed peptides/proteins between OSCC tissues and the corresponding adjacent non-cancerous OSF tissues. Sixty-five unique peptide peaks and nine proteins were identified with altered expression levels. Of them, expression of NCOA7 was found to be up-regulated in OSCC tissues by immunohistochemistry staining and western blotting, and correlated with a pan of clinicopathologic parameters, including lesion site, tumor differentiation status and lymph node metastasis. Further, we show that overexpression of NCOA7 promotes OSCC cell proliferation in either in vitro or in vivo models. Mechanistic study demonstrates that NCOA7 induces OSCC cell proliferation probably by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). The present study suggests that NCOA7 is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis of OSF malignant transformation, and leads to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for OSCC development.},

abstract = {A hospital‐based case‐control study of matched pairs was conducted to explore (a) the relationship between the use of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking and oral cancer and (b) synergism between these factors. The case group consisted of 104 male and 3 female oral cancer patients and these were compared with 194 male and 6 female matched controls. We found by univariate analysis that alcohol consumption, smoking, betel quid chewing, educational level and occupation were associated with oral cancer. The adjusted odds ratios were to be found elevated in patients who were smoking and betel quid chewing. After adjusting for education and occupation covariates, the incidence of oral cancer was computed to be 123‐fold higher in patients who smoked, drank alcohol and chewed betel quid than in obstainers. The synergistic effects of alcohol, tobacco smoke and betel quid in oral cancer were clearly demonstrated, but there was a statistically significant association between oral cancer and betel quid chewing alone. Swallowing betel quid juice (saliva extract of betel quid produced by chewing) or including unripened betel fruit in the quid both seemed to enhance the risks of contracting oral cancer.

Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing promotes differentiation of neural stem cells whereas thymosin beta 4 overexpression initiates cortical folding of developing brain hemispheres. A role of thymosin beta 4 in malignant gliomas has not yet been investigated. We analysed thymosin beta 4 staining on tissue microarrays and performed interrogations of the REMBRANDT and the Cancer Genome Atlas databases. We investigated thymosin beta 4 expression in seven established glioma cell lines and seven glioma-initiating cell lines and induced or silenced thymosin beta 4 expression by lentiviral transduction in LNT-229, U87MG and GS-2 cells to study the effects of altered thymosin beta 4 expression on gene expression, growth, clonogenicity, migration, invasion, self-renewal and differentiation capacity in vitro, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Thymosin beta 4 expression increased with grade of malignancy in gliomas. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in LNT-229 and U87MG glioma cells inhibited migration and invasion, promoted starvation-induced cell death in vitro and enhanced survival of glioma-bearing mice. Thymosin beta 4 gene silencing in GS-2 cells inhibited self-renewal and promoted differentiation in vitro and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Gene expression analysis suggested a thymosin beta 4-dependent regulation of mesenchymal signature genes and modulation of TGFbeta and p53 signalling networks. We conclude that thymosin beta 4 should be explored as a novel molecular target for anti-glioma therapy.},

abstract = {The identification of new biomarkers for preneoplastic pancreatic lesions (PanINs, IPMNs) and early pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is crucial due to the diseases high mortality rate upon late detection. To address this task we used the novel technique of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) on genetically engineered mouse models (GEM) of pancreatic cancer. Various GEM were analyzed with MALDI IMS to investigate the peptide/protein-expression pattern of precursor lesions in comparison to normal pancreas and PDAC with cellular resolution. Statistical analysis revealed several discriminative m/z-species between normal and diseased tissue. Intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) could be distinguished from normal pancreatic tissue and PDAC by 26 significant m/z-species. Among these m/z-species, we identified Albumin and Thymosin-beta 4 by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which were further validated by immunohistochemistry, western blot, quantitative RT-PCR and ELISA in both murine and human tissue. Thymosin-beta 4 was found significantly increased in sera of mice with PanIN lesions. Upregulated PanIN expression of Albumin was accompanied by increased expression of liver-restricted genes suggesting a hepatic transdifferentiation program of preneoplastic cells. In conclusion we show that GEM of endogenous PDAC are a suitable model system for MALDI-IMS and subsequent LC-MS/MS analysis, allowing in situ analysis of small precursor lesions and identification of differentially expressed peptides and proteins.},

abstract = {Oral cancer is the sixth most frequent cancer in the world. Buccal mucosa originated squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one of the most aggressive oral cancers. It mainly occurs in Taiwan, Central and Southeast Asia, and is closely related to the practice of tobacco smoking and betel squid chewing. The high recurrence and low survival rates of buccal SCC remained an important focus for us to understand the pathogenesis of the disease in order to design better therapeutic strategies. Here we applied novel proteomic technology to analyze oral cancer cell lines and paired N/T buccal SCC tissues to identify tumor-associated proteins as new oral cancer biomarkers or molecular targets. We further evaluated a novel cancer therapeutical compound deguelin global protein response in oral cancer cell line SAS. Our result showed a number of proteins were found to be significantly over-expressed or down-regulated in oral cancer cell lines and clinical samples. These increased proteins included glycolytic enzymes, heat-shock proteins, tumor antigens, cytoskeleton proteins, enzymes involved in detoxification and anti-oxidation systems, and proteins involved in mitochondrial and intracellular signaling pathways. These extensive protein variations indicate that multiple cellular pathways were involved in the process of tumorigenesis, and suggest that multiple protein molecules should be simultaneously targeted as an effective strategy to counter the disease. In our results, at least, we have identified Thymosin $\beta$4, ubiquitin, BUB3, in addition to several novel proteins are candidates for targeted proteins in oral cancers. Validation of Thymosin $\beta$4 protein expression in N/T paired oral cancer tissue array by immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that Thymosin $\beta$4 overexpression was found mainly in late clinical stage oral cancer samples. The thymosin $\beta$4/ILK/Akt pathway analysis also showed similar trend for the activation of this pathway in oral cancers. Altogether, the present findings also demonstrated that rich protein information can be produced by means of proteomic analysis for a better understanding of the oncogenesis and pathogenesis in a global way, which in turn is a basis for the rational designs of diagnostic and therapeutic methods in oral cancers.},

Direct MALDI analysis of tissue sections is rapidly demonstrating its potential for protein imaging and profiling in the investigation of a range of disease states including cancer.

Frozen MCF7 breast tumour xenograft and human formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissue sections were used. An improved protocol for on-tissue trypsin digestion is described incorporating the use of a detergent, which increases the yield of tryptic peptides for both fresh frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour tissue sections. A novel approach combining MALDI-MSI and ion mobility separation MALDI-tandem mass spectrometry imaging for improving the detection of low-abundance proteins that are difficult to detect by direct MALDI-MSI analysis is described. In situ protein identification was carried out directly from the tissue section by MALDI-MSI. Numerous protein signals were detected and some proteins including histone H3, H4 and Grp75 that were abundant in the tumour region were identified.},

abstract = {Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise for the field of tissue regeneration. Because only a limited number of MSCs can be obtained from each donor site, it is important to establish standard methods for MSC expansion using growth and trophic factors. Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) is a novel trophic factor that has antimicrobial effects and the potential to promote tissue repair. Tbeta4 is a ubiquitous, naturally-occurring peptide in the wound bed. Therefore, the relationship between Tbeta4 and MSCs, especially adjacent adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs), merits consideration. Exogenous Tbeta4 treatment enhanced the proliferation of human ASCs, resulting in prominent nuclear localization of PCNA immunoreactivity. In addition, exogenous Tbeta4 also increased IL-8 secretion and blocking of IL-8 with neutralizing antibodies decreased Tbeta4-induced ASC proliferation, suggesting that IL-8 is a critical mediator of Tbeta4-enhanced proliferation. Moreover, Tbeta4 activated phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and increased the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. These observation provide that Tbeta4 promotes the expansion of human ASCs via an IL-8-dependent mechanism that involves the ERK and NF-kappaB pathways. Therefore, Tbeta4 could be used as a tool for MSC expansion in cell therapeutics.},

abstract = {Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer spectroscopy we demonstrate that thymosin beta(4) (tbeta(4)) binding induces spatial rearrangements within the small domain (subdomains 1 and 2) of actin monomers in solution. Tbeta(4) binding increases the distance between probes attached to Gln-41 and Cys-374 of actin by 2 A and decreases the distance between the purine base of bound ATP (epsilonATP) and Lys-61 by 1.9 A, whereas the distance between Cys-374 and Lys-61 is minimally affected. Distance determinations are consistent with tbeta(4) binding being coupled to a rotation of subdomain 2. By differential scanning calorimetry, tbeta(4) binding increases the cooperativity of ATP-actin monomer denaturation, consistent with conformational rearrangements in the tbeta(4)-actin complex. Changes in fluorescence resonance energy transfer are accompanied by marked reduction in solvent accessibility of the probe at Gln-41, suggesting it forms part of the binding interface. Tbeta(4) and cofilin compete for actin binding. Tbeta(4) concentrations that dissociate cofilin from actin do not dissociate the cofilin-DNase I-actin ternary complex, consistent with the DNase binding loop contributing to high-affinity tbeta(4)-binding. Our results favor a model where thymosin binding changes the average orientation of actin subdomain 2. The tbeta(4)-induced conformational change presumably accounts for the reduced rate of amide hydrogen exchange from actin monomers and may contribute to nucleotide-dependent, high affinity binding.},

abstract = {Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) is an actin-binding peptide overexpressed in several tumors, including colon carcinomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Tbeta4 in promoting the tumorigenic properties of colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs), which are responsible for tumor initiation and growth. We first found that CR-CSCs from different patients have higher Tbeta4 levels than normal epithelial cells. Then, we used a lentiviral strategy to down-regulate Tbeta4 expression in CR-CSCs and analyzed the effects of such modulation on proliferation, survival, and tumorigenic activity of CR-CSCs. Empty vector-transduced CR-CSCs were used as a control. Targeting of the Tbeta4 produced CR-CSCs with a lower capacity to grow and migrate in culture and, interestingly, reduced tumor size and aggressiveness of CR-CSC-based xenografts in mice. Moreover, such loss in tumorigenic activity was accompanied by a significant increase of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and a concomitant reduction of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) expression, which resulted in a decreased activation of protein kinase B (Akt). Accordingly, exogenous expression of an active form of Akt rescued all the protumoral features lost after Tbeta4 targeting in CR-CSCs. In conclusion, Tbeta4 may have important implications for therapeutic intervention for treatment of human colon carcinoma.},

abstract = {Thymosin $\beta$4 (T$\beta$4), overexpressed in various tumors, has been shown to be involved in cellular anti-oxidation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) function as signaling molecules and play certain roles in tumor progression. To assess the anti-oxidative role of endogenous T$\beta$4 in tumor cells, its expression in SW480 cells was knocked down by a shRNA, which induced significant increases of ROS. Interestingly, some cristae-lost and several electron-dense mitochondria appeared in cells with T$\beta$4 knockdown that was accompanied by a marked decline of the membrane potential of these organelles. Strikingly, while the ATP and lactate levels in SW480 cells were notably elevated by T$\beta$4 downregulation, this treatment significantly diminished the mitochondrial DNA copy number and protein levels of several subunits of the electron transport complexes. Finally, immunofluorescent staining results suggested the presence of T$\beta$4 in mitochondria. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to demonstrate that T$\beta$4 knockdown can disrupt the morphology and some crucial functions of mitochondria in human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cells.

abstract = {The human runt-related transcription factor 3 gene (RUNX3) is considered to be a candidate tumor suppressor gene in gastric carcinoma. However, the role of RUNX3 in the regulation of cell proliferation remains unclear. In the present study, we constructed an adenoviral vector encoding human RUNX3 cDNA under the control of a Tet-responsive promoter (Ad-Tet-FLAG-RUNX3), which regulates the expression of RUNX3 in the presence or absence of doxycycline. A recombinant adenoviral expression vector encoding LacZ (Ad-Tet-LacZ) was used as a negative control. The effect of the transduction of RUNX3 on cell growth was examined using the Tet-On system in a human gastric carcinoma cell line, MKN-1. Exogenous RUNX3 expression was induced successfully by Ad-Tet-FLAG-RUNX3, but not Ad-Tet-LacZ, in the presence of doxycycline in the MKN-1 cells. At 72 h after infection, the proliferative activity in RUNX3-expressing cells was 55{\%} or less of that of the control cells. Flow cytometry revealed that the sub-G(1) peak was increased in cells expressing RUNX3 (34.11{\%}), indicating that the inhibition of cell growth was due to apoptosis, which was confirmed based on Hoechst 33258 staining, the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and detection of cleaved caspase-3 by western blotting in MKN-1 cells. Comprehensive analysis using a cDNA microarray showed that RUNX3 upregulated 17 apoptosis-related genes (including FADD, TRAF6, caspase-2, ING1, ING4, Calpain 10, and DNase1) and downregulated 135 apoptosis-related genes (including FLIP, PEA15, TXN2, HSPD1, IKK, and TIAL1) in MKN-1 cells. Pathway analyses to generate functional networks of the genes suggested that promotion of the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex and activation of the mitochondria-mediated pathway were associated with RUNX3-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our findings suggest that exogenous RUNX3 expression suppressed cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis via the death-receptor mitochondria-mediated pathway in MKN-1 cells.},

abstract = {The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is crucial for the invasion and metastasis of many epithelial tumors including colorectal carcinoma (CRC). In the present study, a scattering and fibroblastic morphology with reduced intercellular contacts was found in the SW480 colon cancer cells overexpressing the gene encoding thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4), which was accompanied by a loss of E-cadherin as well as a cytosolic accumulation of beta-catenin, two most prominent markers of EMT. Whereas E-cadherin downregulation was likely to be accounted by a ZEB1-mediated transcriptional repression, the accumulation of beta-catenin was a result of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta inactivation mediated by integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and/or its downstream effector, Akt. Intriguingly, ILK upregulation in Tbeta4-overexpressing SW480 cells seemed to be attributed mainly to a stabilization of this kinase by complexing with particularly interesting new Cys-His protein (PINCH) more efficiently. In the meantime, a strong correlation between the expression levels of Tbeta4, ILK and E-cadherin in CRC patients was also revealed by immunohistochemical analysis. Taken together, these data suggest a novel role of Tbeta4 in promoting CRC progression by inducing an EMT in tumor cells via upregulating ILK and consequentially its signal transduction.},

abstract = {Carcinoma tissue consists of not only tumor cells but also fibroblasts, endothelial cells or vascular structures, and inflammatory cells forming the supportive tumor stroma. Therefore, the spatial distribution of proteins that promote growth and proliferation in these complex functional units is of high interest. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry is a newly developed technique that generates spatially resolved profiles of protein signals directly from thin tissue sections. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MS)combined with tissue microdissection allows analysis of defined parts of the tissue with a higher sensitivity and a broader mass range. Nevertheless, both MS-based techniques have a limited spatial resolution. IHC is a technique that allows a resolution down to the subcellular level. However, the detection and measurement of a specific protein expression level is possible only by semiquantitative methods. Moreover, prior knowledge about the identity of the proteins of interest is necessary. In this study, we combined all three techniques to gain highest spatial resolution, sensitivity, and quantitative information. We used frozen tissue from head and neck tumors and chose two exemplary proteins (HNP1-3 and S100A8) to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each technique. It could be shown that the combination of these three techniques results in congruent but also synergetic data.},

We applied the matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) to analyze paired normal (N) and tumor (T) samples from head and neck squamous cell carcinoma as well as liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis in HNSCC cell lines to identify tumor-associated biomarkers. Our results showed a number of proteins found to be over- expressed in HNSCC. We identified thymosin beta-4 X-linked (TMSB4X) is one of the most significant candidate biomarkers. Higher TMSB4X expression in the tumor was found by N/T-paired HNSCC samples at both RNA and protein level. Overexpression of TMSB4X was found significantly associated with poor prognosis of overall survival (OS, P = 0.006) and recurrence-free survival (RFS, P = 0.013) in HNSCC patients. Silencing of TMSB4X expression in HNSCC cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro, as well as inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. Altogether, our global proteomics analysis identified that TMSB4X is a newly discovered biomarker in HNSCC whose functions resulted in enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. TMSB4X may be a potential therapeutic target for treating HNSCC patients.},

abstract = {The early stages of angiogenesis are usually accompanied by the occurrence of vascular leakage, and the deposition of fibrin in extravascular spaces. Initially, the fibrin network acts as a sealing matrix, but later on also as a scaffolding for invading endothelial cells. This process is induced by angiogenic growth factors, particularly by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiogenesis involves proteolytic activities, in particular cell-bound urokinase/plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) activities that modulate the fibrin structure and affect adhesion and migration of endothelial cells. Recent data show that formation of new vessels may be stimulated by thymosin beta-4 (Tbeta-4), but it is still not clear whether Tbeta-4 alone is angiogenic or the angiogenic potential of Tbeta-4 is mediated by VEGF. In this report to further characterize Tbeta-4 angiogenic activity, we produced its mutants that were deprived of the N-terminal tetrapeptide AcSDKP (Tbeta-4((AcSDKPT/4A))), the actin-binding sequence KLKKTET (Tbeta-4((KLKKTET/7A))) and with the nuclear localization sequence damaged by a point mutation Lys16Ala (Tbeta-4((K16A))). Then we tested their activity to induce expression and release of MMPs as well as plasminogen activators inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1). We also analyzed their effect on migration and proliferation of endothelial cells in three-dimensional (3D) fibrin matrix as well as on their ability to stimulate the outgrowth of human endothelial cells in capillary-like tubular structures. Our data demonstrate that increased intracellular expression of Tbeta-4 and its mutants is necessary and sufficient to induce PAI-1 gene expression in endothelial cells. Similarly, they stimulate expression and release of MMP-1, -2, and -3. As evaluated by using specific inhibitors to these MMPs, they modified specifically the structure of fibrin and thus facilitated migration of endothelial cells. To sum up, our data show that the mechanism by which Tbeta-4 induced transition of endothelial cells from quiescent to proangiogenic phenotype is characterized by increased expression of PAI-1 and MMPs did not require the presence of the N-terminal sequence AcSDKP, and depended only partially on its ability to bind G-actin or to enter the nucleus.},

abstract = {We identified a thymosin-beta4 gene overexpression in malignant mouse fibrosarcoma cells (QRsP-30) that were derived from clonal weakly tumorigenic and nonmetastatic QR-32 cells by using a differential display method. Thymosin-beta4 is known as a 4.9-kd polypeptide that interacts with G-actin and functions as a major actin-sequestering protein in cells. All of the six malignant fibrosarcoma cell lines that have been independently converted from QR-32 cells expressed high levels of thymosin-beta4 mRNA and its expression in tumor cells was correlated with tumorigenicity and metastatic potential. Up-regulation of thymosin-beta4 in QR-32 cells (32-S) transfected with sense thymosin-beta4 cDNA converted the cells to develop tumors and formed numerous lung metastases in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. In contrast, antisense thymosin-beta4 cDNA-transfected QRsP-30 (30-AS) cells reduced thymosin-beta4 expression, and significantly lost tumor formation and metastases to distant organs. Vector-alone transfected cells (32-V or 30-V cells) behaved like their parental cells. We observed that tumor cell motility, cell shape, and F-actin organization is regulated in proportion to the level of thymosin-beta4 expression. These findings indicate that thymosin-beta4 molecule regulates fibrosarcoma cell tumorigenicity and metastasis through actin-based cytoskeletal organization.},

Using a construct on the skin-specific keratin-5 promoter, we have developed thymosin beta 4 over-expressing transgenic mice to further study its functional roles. Thymosin beta 4 in adult skin and in embryonic stages of the transgenic mouse was analyzed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The over-expression of thymosin beta 4 was observed especially around hair follicles and in the teeth in the transgenic mice. We examined the phenotype of the thymosin beta 4 over-expressing mice. Hair growth was accelerated. In addition, the transgenic mice had abnormally-shaped white teeth and dull incisors. We found that the expression of laminin-5 was up-regulated in the skin of the transgenic mice. We conclude that thymosin beta 4 has an important physiological role in hair growth and in tooth development.},

Mortality data were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2016, 1,685,210 new cancer cases and 595,690 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. Overall cancer incidence trends (13 oldest SEER registries) are stable in women, but declining by 3.1{\%} per year in men (from 2009-2012), much of which is because of recent rapid declines in prostate cancer diagnoses. The cancer death rate has dropped by 23{\%} since 1991, translating to more than 1.7 million deaths averted through 2012. Despite this progress, death rates are increasing for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and uterine corpus, and cancer is now the leading cause of death in 21 states, primarily due to exceptionally large reductions in death from heart disease. Among children and adolescents (aged birth-19 years), brain cancer has surpassed leukemia as the leading cause of cancer death because of the dramatic therapeutic advances against leukemia. Accelerating progress against cancer requires both increased national investment in cancer research and the application of existing cancer control knowledge across all seg- ments of the population.},

abstract = {When human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) differentiate into capillary-like tubes, there is a five-fold upregulation of the mRNA for thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) (Grant et al. J Cell Sci 1995; 108: 3685-94 [1]) and this endogenous expression plays an important role in endothelial cell attachment to and spreading on matrix components. We now show that exogenous addition of thymosin beta4 (in the ng-microg range) to HUVEC in culture can induce several biological responses. These responses include increased tube formation in vitro. Additionally, exogenous thymosin beta4 enhances vascular sprouting in the coronary artery ring angiogenesis assay. Measurements of these vascular sprouts show a doubling of the vessel area (via increased branching) with as little as 100 ng of synthetic thymosin beta4. These processes appear to involve the binding of thymosin beta4 to an unknown cell surface receptor and internalization of the protein. This cell surface-binding appears not to be mediated through the thymosin beta4-actin binding domain LKTET. An increase in thymosin beta4 cytoplasmic staining in HUVEC exposed 10 microg of the peptide appears to occur without increased mRNA translation. In summary Tbeta4 induces an increase in cell-matrix attachment, proliferation, tube formation, internalization of the peptide and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. The data now defines both an autocrine and paracrine role for thymosin beta4 in vessel formation.},

abstract = {With the introduction of recent high-throughput technologies to various fields of science and medicine, it is becoming clear that obtaining large amounts of data is no longer a problem in modern research laboratories. However, coherent study designs, optimal conditions for obtaining high-quality data, and compelling interpretation, in accordance with the evidence-based systems biology, are critical factors in ensuring the emergence of good science out of these recent technologies. This review focuses on the proteomics field and its new perspectives on cancer research. Cornerstone publications that have tremendously helped scientists and clinicians to better understand cancer pathogenesis; to discover novel diagnostic and/or prognostic biomarkers; and to suggest novel therapeutic targets will be presented. The author of this review aims at presenting some of the relevant literature data that helped as a step forward in bridging the gap between bench work results and bedside potentials. Undeniably, this review cannot include all the work that is being produced by expert research groups all over the world.},

abstract = {Our data demonstrate that increased intracellular expression of thymosin beta4(Tbeta4) is necessary and sufficient to induce plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) gene expression in endothelial cells. To describe the mechanism of this effect, we produced Tbeta4 mutants with impaired functional motifs and tested their intracellular location and activity. Cytoplasmic distributions of Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)), Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)), and Tbeta4((K16A)) mutants fused with green fluorescent protein did not differ significantly from those of wild-type Tbeta4. Overexpression of Tbeta4, Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)), and Tbeta4((K16A)) affected intracellular formation of actin filaments. As expected, Tbeta4((K16A)) uptake by nuclei was impaired. On the other hand, overexpression of Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)) resulted in developing the actin filament network typical of adhering cells, indicating that the mutant lacked the actin binding site. The mechanism by which intracellular Tbeta4 induced the PAI-1 gene did not depend upon the N-terminal tetrapeptide AcSDKP and depended only partially on its ability to bind G-actin or enter the nucleus. Both Tbeta4 and Tbeta4((AcSDKPT/4A)) induced the PAI-1 gene to the same extent, whereas mutants Tbeta4((KLKKTET/7A)) and Tbeta4((K16A)) retained about 60{\%} of the original activity. By proteomic analysis, the Ku80 subunit of ATP-dependent DNA helicase II was found to be associated with Tbeta4. Ku80 and Tbeta4 consistently co-immunoprecipitated in a complex from endothelial cells. Co-transfection of endothelial cells with the Ku80 deletion mutants and Tbeta4 showed that the C-terminal arm domain of Ku80 is directly involved in this interaction. Furthermore, down-regulation of Ku80 by specific short interference RNA resulted in dramatic reduction in PAI-1 expression at the level of both mRNA and protein synthesis. These data suggest that Ku80 functions as a novel receptor for Tbeta4 and mediates its intracellular activity.},

abstract = {There is convincing evidence that chronic treatment with N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), a peptide normally found in tissues and biological fluids, reduces collagen deposition in the heart and kidneys of hypertensive rats and rats with myocardial infarction. However, it is not known whether endogenous Ac-SDKP at basal concentrations has any physiological function related to collagen deposition. Prolyl oligopeptidase is responsible for release of Ac-SDKP from its precursor thymosin-beta(4). When we treated rats with a specific oral rolyl oligopeptidase inhibitor, Ac-SDKP decreased significantly in the plasma, heart, and kidney. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that endogenous Ac-SDKP at basal levels plays a physiological role, antagonizing and/or preventing excessive collagen deposition. We studied whether chronic blockade of Ac-SDKP promotes collagen accumulation and/or accelerates this process in the presence of a profibrotic stimulus such as angiotensin II. We found that decreased basal levels of Ac-SDKP increased cardiac and renal perivascular fibrosis and promoted glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, in the presence of angiotensin II decreasing basal levels of Ac-SDKP accelerated interstitial cardiac fibrosis attributable to an increase in cells that produce collagen. We concluded that Ac-SDKP participates in the regulation of collagen content under normal conditions. We believe this is the first study showing that this peptide plays a physiological role at basal concentrations, preventing organ collagen accumulation.},

abstract = {Background: Expression of the small peptide thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 is associated with angiogenesis induction, accelerated wound healing, and the metastatic potential of tumor cells. However, little is known about the mechanism(s) by which thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 promotes metastasis. Methods: Northern blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to examine thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 expression in mouse melanoma B16 cell lines and in B16-F10 cells derived from metastatic mouse lung tumors, respectively. B16-F10 cells infected with adenoviruses containing a thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 expression vector or an empty vector were injected subcutaneously and intravenously into C57BL/6 mice to evaluate tumor growth and metastatic potential, respectively. In vitro assays were used to study cell migration, invasion, matrix metalloproteinase activity, cell proliferation, and angiogenic activity of adenovirus-infected B16-F10 cells. Statistical significance of all results was analyzed by two-tailed Student's t tests. Results: Thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 mRNA was expressed in primary cultured B16-F10 cells derived from lung metastases and in B16-F10 cells that had formed lung tumors after being injected into mice but not in the B16-F1, B16-F10, or B16-BL6 cell lines. The mean tumor sizes in mice 20 days after injection with B16-F10 cells infected with thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4-expressing adenovirus and with control adenovirus were 21.7 mm (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 17.7 to 25.7 mm) and 13.3 mm (95{\%} CI = 11.1 to 15.3 mm), respectively (difference = 8.4 mm; P = .036). The mean numbers of metastatic lung nodules in mice (n = 20) 2 weeks after intravenous injection with thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4-expressing adenovirus and with control adenovirus were 46.7 (95{\%} CI = 35.0 to 57.7) and 10.9 (95{\%} CI = 6.2 to 15.6), respectively (difference = 35.8 metastatic lung nodules, P{\textless}.001). Thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 overexpression was associated with a mean 2.3-fold increase (95{\%} CI = 1.9- to 2.7-fold increase; P{\textless}.001) in B16-F10 cell migration and a mean 4.4-fold increase (95{\%} CI = 3.3- to 5.5-fold increase; P{\textless}.001) in the number of blood vessels in solid tumors derived from injected B16-F10 cells but had no effect on cell invasion, proliferation, or matrix metalloproteinase activity. This induction of angiogenesis by thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 was associated with induction of vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Conclusion: Thymosin {\{}beta{\}}4 may stimulate tumor metastasis by activating cell migration and angiogenesis.},

Although some mechanistic insights into adverse neurological actions of these NMDA receptor antagonists exist, our understanding of the full spectrum of developmental events affected by early exposure to these chemical agents in the brain is still limited. Here we attempt to gain insights into the impact of pharmacologically induced excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in infancy on the brain proteome using mass spectrometric imaging (MSI). Our goal was to study changes in protein expression in postnatal day 10 (P10) rat brains following neonatal exposure to the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine (MK801). Analysis of rat brains exposed to vehicle or MK801 and comparison of their MALDI MS images revealed differential relative abundances of several proteins. We then identified these markers such as ubiquitin, purkinje cell protein 4 (PEP-19), cytochrome c oxidase subunits and calmodulin, by a combination of reversed-phase (RP) HPLC fractionation and top-down tandem MS platform. More in-depth large scale study along with validation experiments will be carried out in the future. Overall, our findings indicate that a brief neonatal exposure to a compound that alters excitatory/inhibitory balance in the brain has a long term effect on protein expression patterns during subsequent development, highlighting the utility of MALDI-MSI as a discovery tool for potential biomarkers.},

abstract = {Abstract: Thymosin $\beta$4 (T$\beta$4) is a ubiquitous, naturally occurring, 43-amino acid peptide that takes part in several biological activities including angiogenesis, inhibition of inflammation, wound healing, chemotaxis, and endothelial cell migration. Recent studies also indicate that T$\beta$4 accelerates corneal wound healing and downregulates several proinflamatory chemokines and cytokines. In this study, we sought to determine whether T$\beta$4 is naturally occurring in human tears and other human bodily fluids, such as saliva. Tear and saliva samples were analyzed by EIA to identify and quantify the amount of T$\beta$4 present. Around 10–20 samples were collected from each of three different age groups: 15–20, 25–35, and {\textgreater}50 years old with n= 30 and n= 60 for tears and saliva, respectively. Exclusion criteria included the use of any topical ophthalmic or topical oral medication and/or history of ocular or oral surgery within the past 6 months. Tears were collected from both eyes using Schirmer's strips. Saliva samples were collected in sterile tubes and were then centrifuged to remove solid particles. T$\beta$4 was found in tear and saliva samples in all age groups. The concentrations ranged from 0.5–7 $\mu$g/mL in tears and 0.2–3.6 $\mu$g/mL in saliva. In both fluids, T$\beta$4 concentration varied with age and appeared to peak at ages 25–35 years. Studies are in progress to determine if T$\beta$4 levels in saliva and tears demonstrate a circadian rhythm during a 24-h period, as well as to confirm that they vary with age and to explore if they vary with diseased states. This is the first study to report the presence of T$\beta$4 in human tears and saliva. This finding raises the possibility that T$\beta$4 acts as an endogenous agent contributing to the rapid healing of corneal and oral wounds. Considering that T$\beta$4 facilitates reepithelialization and modulates anti-inflammatory mediators, T$\beta$4 could potentially be used therapeutically in the treatment of (a) ocular surface disease and injury of eye and (b) various oral disorders, such as periodontal disease.},

Tbeta4 was weakly expressed in the hMLH1-deficient cell lines 293T and HCT-116. Reconstitution of hMLH1 resulted in strong expression of Tbeta4. Confocal laser microscopy revealed nuclear colocalization of both proteins. Reconstitution with hMLH1 mutants lacking a functional nuclear localization sequence resulted in cytoplasmatic retention of both proteins. After Tbeta4- or hMLH1-siRNA treatment, cell migration of hMLH1-proficient cells was markedly decreased. Our results show that hMLH1 interacts with Tbeta4 and regulates its expression and nuclear transport. Moreover, loss of hMLH1 causes Tbeta4 deprivation and results in reduced migratory activity in vitro. These data give insight into novel functions of hMLH1 and probably disease related dysregulated mechanisms.},

abstract = {The development of thymosin beta(4) from a thymic hormone to an actin-sequestering peptide and back to a cytokine supporting wound healing will be outlined. Thymosin fraction 5 consists of a mixture of polypeptides and improves immune response. Starting with fraction 5, several main peptides (thymosin alpha(1), polypeptide beta(1), and thymosin beta(4)) were isolated and tested for biological activity. However, none of the isolated peptides were really thymic hormones. They are all biological important peptides with diverse functions. Polypeptide beta(1) is identical to ubiquitin truncated by two C-terminal glycine residues. Several peptides related to thymosin beta(4) were isolated and sequenced from various species. Large amounts of thymosin beta(4) were found in many cells. It was postulated that the beta-thymosins might have a general function. The identification of a biological function of thymosin beta(4) was tedious. In 1990, Dan Safer and his colleagues recognized that thymosin beta(4) sequesters G-actin. The dissociation constant of the complex in the micromolar range allows for fast binding and release of G-actin. beta-Thymosins are the main intracellular G-actin-sequestering peptides in most vertebrate cells. Thymosin beta(4) is unstructured but folds into a stable conformation on binding to G-actin. It is present in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasm and might be responsible for sequestering nuclear actin. Several biological effects are attributed to thymosin beta(4), oxidized thymosin beta(4), or to ac-SDKP possibly generated from thymosin beta(4). However, very little is known about molecular mechanisms mediating the effects attributed to extracellular beta-thymosins.},

OSCC is usually diagnosed at advanced clinical stages, resulting in poor outcomes. To identify effective biomarkers for improved OSCC diagnosis and/or management, we simultaneously analyzed the OSCC cell secretome and tissue transcriptome. Among the 19 candidates isolated, guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) was selected for further validation using serum samples from OSCC patients and healthy controls. Notably, the serum level of GBP1 was higher in OSCC patients, compared to that in healthy controls. Immunohistochemical analysis further revealed GBP1 overexpression in OSCC tissues, compared with adjacent noncancerous epithelia. Importantly, the higher GBP1 level in OSCC tissue was associated with higher overall pathological stage, positive perineural invasion, and poorer prognosis. Moreover, GBP1 modulated the migration and invasion of OSCC cells in vitro. Our results collectively indicate that integrated analysis of the cancer secretome and transcriptome is a feasible strategy for the efficient identification of novel OSCC markers.},

The corresponding constant for thymosin-beta4.pyrenyl-Actin, however, was significantly higher ( approximately 9-10 microM), suggesting that the fluorophore markedly weakens binding to thymosin-beta4. With solutions of actin (2 microM) and thymosin-beta4 (2 or 4 microM), the barbed-end assembly rate rose with increasing profilin concentration (0.7-2 microM). Actin assembly in presence of thymosin-beta4 and profilin fit a simple thermodynamic energy cycle, thereby disproving an earlier claim (D. Pantaloni and M.-F.

abstract = {Background: To identify common gene expression patterns among two uniquely matched pairs of primary and metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines derived from the same two patient donors. Methods: Two pairs of cell lines derived from the primary tumors and lymph node metastases of the same two patients were used to obtain microarray-based gene expression profiles. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm observed changes for some of the candidate genes. Results: Approximately 50{\%} of the genes profiled were expressed in all four cell lines. Cluster analysis identified a group of 17 genes whose expression correlated inversely with metastatic progression. Only 10 common genes were differentially expressed in both pairs of primary and metastatic cells. A group of 28 highly expressed genes was common for both metastatic cell lines, among them some of the known metastasis-related genes such as laminin receptor, thymosin $\beta$-4 and $\beta$-10 and metallopanstimulin. Conclusions: Groups of presumed metastasis-related genes are highly heterogeneous and vary significantly between the two patients. Thus, it is unlikely that the metastatic phenotype of these OSCC cells is acquired by de-regulation of a single gene or a group of few genes. Most likely, multiple combinations of differentially expressed genes are involved in facilitating metastatic spread of these oral carcinoma cell lines.},

abstract = {The localization of Oregon Green cadaverine-labeled thymosin beta(4), its fragments, and variants was investigated in cytoplasm-depleted A431 cells and in microinjected cells without and with fixation. The studied thymosin beta(4) variants included substitutions of the lysine residues within the basic cluster (14-KSKLKK-19) and the actin-binding motif (17-LKKTETQ-23). In contrast to Oregon Green cadaverine, none of the variants or fragments of thymosin beta(4) could pass the intact nuclear pore of cytoplasm-depleted cells and were hence excluded from the nucleus. However, an equal distribution of all thymosin beta(4) variants was observed in living cells. The nuclear localization is neither dependent on the actin-binding ability of thymosin beta(4) nor on its basic lysine cluster. The equal distribution of the beta-thymosins, the ability of the fragments thymosin beta(4)(1-26) and beta(4)(27-43) to enter the nucleus in intact cells immediately after injection, and their exclusion from cytoplasm-depleted nuclei make it unlikely that they are transported by a single transport protein. A passive but regulated diffusion could explain the described ability of thymosin beta(4) to shuttle into the nucleus.},

abstract = {Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare but very aggressive form of breast cancer. Its definition is based on clinical criteria, but a molecular definition could be useful when data are incomplete or features are missing. Recently, the identification of overexpression of E-cadherin in IBC has improved understanding of the molecular basis of this disease. Consequently, the aim of this study was to try to determine an immunophenotypic 'signature' of IBC. A series of 80 cases of IBC were compared with 552 non-IBC control cases and a model was elaborated to evaluate the probability of an inflammatory carcinoma being present in any clinical situation. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were used to determine the immunohistochemical profile of eight proteins including E-cadherin, EGFR, oestrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR), MIB1, ERBB2, MUC1, and P53. All the parameters tested were differentially expressed between IBC and control cases in univariate analysis (p {\textless} 0.001). The five variables that were significantly associated with IBC in multivariate analysis were E-cadherin {\textgreater} or = 300 [HR = 5.64 (2.92-10.87)], ER negative [HR = 3.00 (1.67-5.51)], MIB1 {\textgreater} 20 [HR = 3.54 (1.87-6.71)], MUC1 cytoplasmic staining [HR = 2.72 (1.49-4.96)], and ERBB2 positive 2+ or 3+ [HR = 2.46 (1.26-4.78)]. The probability that a breast cancer with this full phenotype at diagnosis was an IBC was 90.5{\%}. If any one of the five parameters was missing, this probability dropped to 75{\%} and was less than 50{\%} when one, two, or three parameters were present. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of patients with IBC were not significantly different from those of the non-IBC control group that expressed four or five parameters (nIBC-1), but this nIBC-1 control group had a significantly worse outcome than the non-IBC control group (nIBC-2) with only 0-3 parameters (p = 0.0049 for OS and p {\textless} 0.0001 for DFS). In conclusion, an immunophenotypic signature was suggested for IBC. This could help to determine the worst cases, independent of clinical criteria.},

abstract = {Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 are key transcription factors critical for the pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Their downregulations lead to differentiation, accompanied with changes in cell motility. Whether these factors impact cell motility directly, however, is not clear. Here we addressed this question by initially assessing their effect in non-stem cells. We found that the ectopic expression of Nanog, Sox2, or Oct4 markedly inhibited ECV304 cell migration. Detailed examinations revealed that Nanog induced disorganizations of the actin cytoskeleton and peripheral localizations of focal adhesions. These effects required its DNA-binding domain and are thus transcription dependent. Furthermore, thymosin beta4 and Rnd3 were identified as its downstream targets. Their depletions in ECV304 cells by RNAi phenocopied the ectopic expression of Nanog in both cell motility and actin organization, whereas their ectopic expressions rescued the migration defect of Nanog overexpression. Both proteins were upregulated during mouse ES cell differentiation. Their levels in the pluripotent mouse P19 cells also increased upon Nanog ablation, coincident with an increase in cell motility. Moreover, persistent expression of Nanog in zebrafish embryos suppressed gastrulation and cell migration. These results indeed suggest a dual role of certain transcription factors in the orchestration of differentiation and motility.},

We found that thymosin beta4 induces VEGF expression by an increase in the stability of HIF-1alpha protein. Analysis of the expression patterns of thymosin beta4 and HIF-1alpha in colon cancer tissue microarray showed that thymosin beta4 and HIF-1alpha co-localized in these biopsies.

Thirty-two genes fell into the group of commonly upregulated genes. In addition, we immunohistochemically investigated the expression of the four top ranked upregulated genes, Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), and mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), in 44 CRC. JAK3 staining was located in the cancer cells. A comparison of JAK3 immunostaining and clinicopathological parameters showed a significant association of tumor differentiation, pT, and TMN stage. Staining of MMP13 and HSP60 was noted mainly in the cytoplasm of cancer cells. A significant association of these expressions was observed with tumor differentiation and pT. MDM2 staining was noted in the nucleus of cancer and non-cancer cells. No significant association of clinicopathological parameters with MDM2 expression was observed. In multivariate analysis, JAK3 immunoreactivity showed independent prognostically unfavorable predictors. These data suggest that JAK3, in particular, is a highly significant, prognostic immunohistochemical marker in CRC. This study proves that cDNA microarrays, plotted by a small number of genes from a few samples, are both practical and useful. ?? 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Thymosin beta4 is regarded as the main G-actin sequestering peptide in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. It is also thought to be involved in cellular events like cancerogenesis, apoptosis, angiogenesis, blood coagulation and wound healing. Thymosin beta4 has been previously reported to localise intracellularly to the cytoplasm as detected by immunofluorescence. It can be selectively labelled at two of its glutamine-residues with fluorescent Oregon Green cadaverine using transglutaminase; however, this labelling does not interfere with its interaction with G-actin. Here we show that after microinjection into intact cells, fluorescently labelled thymosin beta4 has a diffuse cytoplasmic and a pronounced nuclear staining. Enzymatic cleavage of fluorescently labelled thymosin beta4 with AsnC-endoproteinase yielded two mono-labelled fragments of the peptide. After microinjection of these fragments, only the larger N-terminal fragment, containing the proposed actin-binding sequence exhibited nuclear localisation, whereas the smaller C-terminal fragment remained confined to the cytoplasm. We further showed that in digitonin permeabilised and extracted cells, fluorescent thymosin beta4 was solely localised within the cytoplasm, whereas it was found concentrated within the cell nuclei after an additional Triton X100 extraction. Therefore, we conclude that thymosin beta4 is specifically translocated into the cell nucleus by an active transport mechanism, requiring an unidentified soluble cytoplasmic factor. Our data furthermore suggest that this peptide may also serve as a G-actin sequestering peptide in the nucleus, although additional nuclear functions cannot be excluded.},

abstract = {Human malignant melanoma has poor prognosis because of resistance to apoptosis and therapy. We describe identification of the expression profile of 1,037 mitochondria-focused genes and 84 survival-apoptosis genes in 21 malignant melanoma cell lines and 3 normal melanocyte controls using recently developed hMitChip3 cDNA micro-arrays. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of 1,037 informative genes, and 84 survival-apoptosis genes, classified these malignant melanoma cell lines into type A (n = 12) and type B (n = 9). Three hundred fifty-five of 1,037 (34.2{\%}) genes displayed significant (P ≤ 0.030; false discovery rate ≤ 3.68{\%}) differences (±≥2.0- fold) in average expression, with 197 genes higher and 158 genes lower in type A than in type B. Of 84 genes with known survival-apoptosis functions, 38 (45.2{\%}) displayed the significant (P {\textless} 0.001; false discovery rate {\textless} 0.15{\%}) difference. Antiapoptotic (BCL2, BCL2A1, PPARD, and RAF1), antioxidant (MT3, PRDX5, PRDX3, GPX4, GLRX2, and GSR), and proapoptotic (BAD, BNIP1, APAF1, BNIP3L, CASP7, CYCS, CASP1, and VDAC1) genes expressed at higher levels in type A than in type B, whereas the different set of antiapoptotic (PSEN1, PPP2CA, API5, PPP2R1B, PPP2R1A, and FIS1), antioxidant (HSPD1, GSS, SOD1, ATOX1, and CAT), and proapoptotic (ENDOG, BAK1, CASP2, CASP4, PDCD5, HTRA2, SEPT4, TNFSF10, and PRODH) genes expressed at lower levels in type A than in type B. Microarray data were validated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. These results showed the presence of two types of malignant melanoma, each with a specific set of dysregulated survival-apoptosis genes, which may prove useful for development of new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention and novel diagnostic biomarkers for treatment and prognosis of malignant melanoma.},

B(a)P and DMBA are key carcinogens in tobacco smoke. In the present study, for the first time we established the cancerous cell line OSCC-BD induced by B(a)P/DMBA mixture and transformed from dysplastic oral leukoplakia cell line DOK. Cell morphology, proliferation ability, migration ability, colony formation, and tumorigenicity were studied and confirmed the malignant characteristics of OSCC-BD cells. We further identified the differential proteins between DOK and OSCC-BD cells by stable isotope dimethyl labeling based quantitative proteomic method, which showed 18 proteins up-regulated and 16 proteins down-regulated with RSD {\textless} 8{\%}. Differential proteins are mainly related to cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA replication, RNA splicing and apoptosis. Abberant binding function, catalysis activity and transportor activity of differential proteins might contribute to the malignant transformation of OLK. Of the 34 identified differential proteins with RSD {\textless} 8{\%}, 13 novel cancer-related proteins were reported in the present study. This study might provide a new insight into the mechanism of OLK malignant transformation and the potent biomarkers for early diagnosis, meanwhile further facilitate the application of the quantification proteomics to carcinogenesis research.},

CK17 was further validated in vitro (cellular carcinogenesis model and other three OSCC lines) and in vivo (tissues from six healthy persons and 30 primary OSCC patients) by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry respectively.Results: Increased CK17 expression was identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography–tandem mass chromatography in the HB56 and HB96 cells over HIOECs. Western blotting confirmed the increased CK17 expression in the HB56, HB96 cells and other three OSCC lines. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the increased CK17 expression in the cancerous tissues from OSCC patients compared with the paired adjacent non-malignant epithelia.Conclusion: Increased CK17 expression may play an important role in the carcinogenesis progression of OSCC; however, further studies on the molecular function of CK17 are encouraged to clear the precise mechanism of CK17 in OSCC.},

We report here methodology for the preparation and analysis of LCM captured cells with MALDI MS, giving high sensitivity and mass resolution. Comparison of the spectra obtained from cell populations of interest can identify unique disease or function-related protein markers. Using this approach, mass spectra obtained from human breast tissue containing invasive mammary carcinoma and normal breast epithelium using LCM were compared. Over 40 peaks were identified that significantly differed in intensity between invasive mammary carcinoma and normal breast epithelium. In addition, mass spectra are presented that show protein patterns from mouse liver and mouse colon crypts. The reported tissue preparation procedure and subsequent analysis by MALDI MS provide a new methodology for protein discovery involving LCM captured cells. ?? 2002 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.},

abstract = {Novel high-throughput sample preparation strategies for MALDI imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) and profiling are presented. An acoustic reagent multispotter was developed to provide improved reproducibility for depositing matrix onto a sample surface, for example, such as a tissue section. The unique design of the acoustic droplet ejector and its optimization for depositing matrix solution are discussed. Since it does not contain a capillary or nozzle for fluid ejection, issues with clogging of these orifices are avoided. Automated matrix deposition provides better control of conditions affecting protein extraction and matrix crystallization with the ability to deposit matrix accurately onto small surface features. For tissue sections, matrix spots of 180-200 microm in diameter were obtained and a procedure is described for generating coordinate files readable by a mass spectrometer to permit automated profile acquisition. Mass spectral quality and reproducibility was found to be better than that obtained with manual pipet spotting. The instrument can also deposit matrix spots in a dense array pattern so that, after analysis in a mass spectrometer, two-dimensional ion images may be constructed. Example ion images from a mouse brain are presented.},

abstract = {A unique feature of SW480 and SW620 colon carcinoma cell lines is that they are derived from primary and secondary tumours resected from a single patient. As such, they may represent a valuable resource for examining genetic changes late in colon cancer progression. In order to verify this, both cell lines have been characterized to determine whether phenotypic differences have been retained despite long-term cell culture in vitro. The primary tumour-derived SW480 cells have an epithelioid morphology in vitro, while metastasis-derived SW620 cells have a fibroblast-like appearance. Xenografts of SW480 cells form gland-like structures in vivo, while SW620 xenografts form solid sheets of tumour cells. SW620 cells have a higher BrdU labelling index than SW480 cells, and are more highly tumourigenic and metastatic. Furthermore, SW620 cells show less susceptibility to apoptosis induction by TNF$\alpha$ and anti-Fas monoclonal. Findings from these investigations therefore indicate that SW480 and SW620 cell lines do show appropriate phenotypic differences and represent an interesting model for studying the genetic events in the late stages of colon cancer progression.

To assess the effect of different patterns of smoking, chewing and alcohol drinking in the development of the above 3 neoplasms and to determine the interaction among these habits, we conducted a case-control study in Chennai and Trivandrum, South India. The cases included 1,563 oral, 636 pharyngeal and 566 esophageal male cancer patients who were compared with 1,711 male disease controls from the 2 centers as well as 1,927 male healthy hospital visitors from Chennai. We observed a significant dose-response relationship for duration and amount of consumption of the 3 habits with the development of the 3 neoplasms. Tobacco chewing emerged as the strongest risk factor for oral cancer, with the highest odds ratio (OR) for chewing products containing tobacco of 5.05 [95{\%} confidence internal (CI) 4.26-5.97]. The strongest risk factor for pharyngeal and esophageal cancers was tobacco smoking, with ORs of 4.00 (95{\%} CI 3.07-5.22) and 2.83 (95{\%} CI 2.18-3.66) in current smokers, respectively. An independent increase in risk was observed for each habit in the absence of the other 2. For example, the OR of oral cancers for alcohol drinking in never smokers and never chewers was 2.56 (95{\%} CI 1.42-4.64) and that of esophageal cancers was 3.41 (95{\%} CI 1.46-7.99). Furthermore, significant decreases in risks for all 3 cancer sites were observed in subjects who quit smoking even among those who had quit smoking 2-4 years before the interview.},
