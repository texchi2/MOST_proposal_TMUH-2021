\begin{abstract}


\textbf{Background:}
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (\acrshort{hnscc}) represents a significant health concern worldwide. Surgery and systemic therapy are still the standard of care for \acrshort{hnscc} patients. The break-through improvement of those interventions should depend on 1) the discovery of high impact prognostic biomarkers, and 2) proper treatment planning by accurate sub-population of those patients.
The survival analysis of the \acrfull{tcga} dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based biomarkers of \acrshort{hnscc}. It is necessary to determine a cutoff point of the patients' dichotomization in survival analysis with the continuous gene expression measurements. There is some optimization software for cutoff mining.
However, the software's determination of cutoffs is usually set at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of \acrfull{rnaseq} value to find a significant \textit{P} value by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. There are few clinicopathological or spiritual features available on their pre-processed data sets.
The survival analysis could conclude the manifest of clinical, pathological, and transcriptomics data to find the prognostic biomarkers.

%Methods: how the study was performed and statistical tests used
\textbf{Methods:}
R script was used to develop a comprehensive workflow, named "pvalueTex", running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling to discover prognostic biomarkers.
We further plan to develop a deep-learning based data mining as well as validation platform. It might incorporate whole slide images of pathology from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and Taipei Medical University (TMU) biobank.
%RNA-Seq data of \acrfull{tcga} for survival analysis. 
Graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) will be used for feature extraction from whole slide images.
Recurrent neural network (RNN) will deal with "holistic features" from electric healthcare records (EHR) of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH).
These patient's features should include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information investigated by physicians.

% Results: the main findings
\textbf{Preliminary Results:}
Using pvalueTex on the \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500) programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders, we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient survival. 
According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni adjusted \textit{P} value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard ratio $(>=1.5)$, there were ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, which are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of \acrfull{os}. At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients (with hazard ratio $<=0.5$), named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB.

% Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications
\textbf{Conclusions:}
%Those 11 validated biomarkers (DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, NDFIP1, STIP1, DKC1, ZNF557, ZNF266, and FCGBP), 
The candidate biomarkers, clinical tumor size, and surgical margin status are independent prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc}.
We suggest that expression data of \acrshort{rnaseq} with associated pathological images and holistic features will help to facilitate the biomarker discovery in terms of tumor-agnostic therapy.

%Survival analysis using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset is a well-known method to discover gene expression-based prognostic biomarkers of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). It is necessary to determine a cutoff point by patients' dichotomization for the continuous gene expression. Usually, an optimization algorithm for cutoff determination has been set at the median or quantiles of RNA sequencing value.

%2) better prognosis: IL19 (0.049731), FCGBP (0.005658), KIAA1683 (IQCN, 0.005886), NPB (0.014177);\\

% row 20: The result showed ten overexpressed genes (symbol as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. Furthermore, the other ten overexpressed genes (symbol as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

\section*{Biological Hallmarks of Cancer}

The multi-step process of genetic alteration is contributing to the development of cancer. The accumulation of mutation, amplification, or chromosomal aberrations in proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes might be the consequence of the stimulation from intrinsic or extrinsic environments.
Since cancer cells acquired the ten biological hallmarks, these functional capabilities consist of sustaining proliferative signaling and evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion with metastasis, deregulating cellular energetics and metabolism, avoiding immune destruction, tumor-promoting inflammation, and genome instability and mutation \citep{Hanahan2000, Hanahan2011, Hanahan2017}. The tumor micro-environment, which is composed of cancer cells and tumor‐associated fibroblasts, infiltrating immune cells, and angiogenic vascular cells.

metabolic reprogramming
The concept that cancer cells alter their utilization of energy sources—notably glucose—to support their proliferation was introduced almost 90 years ago by Otto Warburg, who observed that certain cultured-cancer cells have enhanced uptake of glucose, which is metabolized via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen levels that normally should favor oxidative phosphorylation.

\section*{Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma}
\label{sec:section}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which is derived from the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, is the sixth common cancer worldwide \citep{Siegel2016}, as well as the fourth leading cancer causes of death for males in Taiwan  \citep{MOHW_death2017}. The age-standardized incidence rate of \acrshort{hnscc} in males is 42.43 per 100,000 persons \citep{MOHW_incidence2018}. 
 Primary prevention by minimizing exposure to known carcinogens is promising, but limited success is achieved due to addiction, economic, or social issues.
 In Asian population, ALDH2 mutaion plays a very important rule to cause HNSCC.
The mortality rate of HNSCC patients in the male is 11.1-fold greater than that in women.
Some factors, including carcinogens in tobacco and betel nut, consumption of alcohol, \acrfull{hpv} infection, physical irritations, or host susceptibility, may contribute to the etiology of HNSCC \citep{Ko1995,Znaori2003} (Figure \ref{fig:DAG_etiology}).

The modern treatment of HNSCC should be done by surgery alone, radiation therapy alone, or a combination of them with adjuvant chemotherapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines \citep{Pfishter2019}. Despite those interventions, the 5-year survival rate for this disease has improved only marginally over the past decade, and recurrent disease is observed in ~50\% of all patients \citep{Forastiere2001,Warnakulasuriya2009}. By comparison with new systemic treatments seen in other solid tumours, the prognostic result of targeted therapy, ex. EGFR inhibitors, in HNSCC patients has remained relatively stationary in recent years. \citep{Argiris2015a}.

Introduction

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which is derived from the oral cavity, oropharynx and hypopharynx in more than 90\% \citep{Warnakulasuriya2009}, is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. The mortality rate of HNSCC patients in the male is 11.1-fold greater than that in women. The age-standardized incidence rate of HNSCC in males exceeds 30 in 100,000 populations in Taiwan \citep{MOHW2016, MOHW_incidence2018}.
% trend from 2016 to 2018?
Some factors, including virus infection, alcohol, carcinogens in betel quid and tobacco, physical irritations, or host susceptibility, may contribute to HNSCC \citep{Ko1995} \citep{Znaori2003}. The modern treatment of HNSCC should be done by surgery alone, radiation therapy alone, or a combination of them with adjuvant chemotherapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines \citep{Pfister2020a}. Despite those interventions, the 5-year survival rate for this disease has improved only marginally over the past decade, and recurrent disease is observed in 50\% of all patients \citep{Warnakulasuriya2009} \citep{Forastiere2001}. By comparison with modern systemic therapies seen in other solid tumors, the prognostic result of targeted therapy, ex. EGFR inhibitors, in HNSCC patients has remained relatively stationary in recent years \citep{Argiris2015a}. Patients with early-stage cancer often manifest minimal physical evidence, which usually ignored by themselves, resulting in delayed diagnosis regarding poor tumor control and patient survival. Therefore, quitting bad habits, routine screening in high-risk population and early intervention will be helpful to improve their survival while maintaining the quality of life. The key advancement of those interventions should be i) the discovery of high impact diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, ii) and planning of the proper treatment modalities for accurate sub-grouped HNSCC patients.
Recent decade, proteomics analysis is a promising approach to the identification of proteins with various abundance related to the prognostic categorisation of cancer \citep{Sallam2015}. MALDI IMS generates profiles and two-dimensional ion density maps of molecules, which are primarily peptides or proteins, directly from the surface of thin tissue sections of HNSCC \citep{Xie2016}. These data give the relative abundance of the molecules with their spatial distribution in tissue samples. Comparative proteomics analysis by using LC-MS/MS analysis to identify the differentially expressed proteins in HNSCC was also reported in previous articles \citep{Wei2009} \citep{Chanthammachat2013}. 
Here we used both MALDI IMS and LC-MS/MS for the biomarker mining. In consensus candidates from these two modalities, TMSB4X has lowest expression level in normal oral mucosa, whereas it is highly abundant in late-stage HNSCC samples. Then, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to confirm the expression level of endogenous TMSB4X with clinicopathological survival analysis. Furthermore, we knocked down TMSB4X in HNSCC cell line and found that tumor growth and metastasis is attenuated. Taking all together, through multiple proteomics approaches we elucidated that TMSB4X might be a new candidate for HNSCC therapy.

chronic inflammation by mechanical force or chemicals

** or even in autoimmune disease:
Risks from disease and treatment
Autoimmune disorders generally attack a single organ or part of the body, often causing inflammation in the affected area. In some cases, that inflammation may increase cancer risk. 
At the same time, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or immunosuppressant (e.x. cyclosporin), help reduce inflammation and also are suspected of increasing the risk of multiple cancers. It may impair the ability to kill cancer cells.

two of ten hallmarks: avoiding immune destruction, tumor-promoting inflammation \citep{Ohman2015}



The basic principles that guide cancer immunology are immune surveillance \citep{BURNET1957, Shankaran2001}, immune editing, and immune tolerance.
%immunosurveillance
Peritumoral immune responses might predict patients’ prognosis in a wide range of cancers. Beyond local accumulation, systemic immune response in serum is seen in patients with \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Lee2010a}.
% immunoediting 敵消我長的過程
Moreover, the immune response is not only achieving protection of the host but also editing the immunogenicity of tumours \citep{Dunn2002}.
The cancer immunoediting includes elimination, equilibrium then escape.
%elimination by immunosurveillance
The cells, which have aberrant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, will be eliminated by cytotoxic mechanism or induction of apoptosis by immune cells, involving granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), macrophages, natural
killer cells, in innate immunity \citep{Tallerico2013}.
Tumour-associated macrophages include  M1, which has antitumoral properties, and M2, which has tumour-promoting phenotype in \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Kumar2019}.

Through dendritic cells presenting the tumor antigens to T helper cells in context with MHC class II molecules, naive or memory T cells will conduct activation of  T cells and adaptive immunity \citep{Banchereau2000}. 
The plasmacytoid cells are a subtype of dendritic cells that are one of the main sources of secreting \acrshort{ifng}. 
T cells consist of at least five subgroups: Th1 (CD4+), Th2 (CD4+), Th17 (CD4+), regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+ Tregs), and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). 
Cytotoxic T cells is triggered by helper T cells to attack directly and execute those tumor cells, whose antigen is presented by dendritic cells, via effector molecules such as perforin and granzyme. Cytotoxic T cells also use TRAIL receptor to release signal on tumor's FasL to induce cell apoptosis.
% By inducing intracellular signaling through lck, the CD8 coreceptor is an important factor affecting TCR‐mediated T cell activation and modulation of immunosuppression and cytotoxicity.
All subsets play important roles in mucosal immune response, including antitumoral responses. T cells represent approximately 10\% of the total cells in a tumour mass \citep{Balkwill2012}.

% equilibrium under immunoselection:  Cancer cells avoid immunosurveillance by the selection of non-immunogenic tumour-cell variants % 鄭爺爺
***When immunosurveillance systems are not able to eradicate the tumor cells, the result may be tumor dormancy, where an equilibrium with defending cells occurs.

equilibrium represents a time of tumour cell persistence without progression.
equilibrium is maintained solely by adaptive immunity
The interplay of the potentially malignant cells and immune cells from immunosurveillance, equilibrium to tumor escape.
Lymphocytes of adaptive immunity have the capacity to take over and exert enough antitumoral effects to kill and limit tumour growth, and the tumour is thus kept in their dormitory \citep{Koebel2007}.
The tumour cells in equilibrium are highly immunogenic (unedited), whereas those spontaneously exiting equilibrium (escape) that become growing tumours have attenuated immunogenicity (edited)—results that place this process temporally between elimination and escape \citep{Koebel2007}.
maintaining cancer in an equilibrium state may represent a relevant goal of cancer immunotherapy in which augmentation of adaptive tumour immunity could result in improved tumour control. *** A TREATMENT GOALS

% Death receptors:  tumour-necrosis-factor (TNF) receptor 1, CD95 (also known as FAS) and two receptors for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAILR1 and TRAILR2).


% escape under immunesubversion: by the active suppression of the immune response
Escape is the process wherein the immunologically sculpted tumor expands in an uncontrolled manner in the immunocompetent host \citep{Dunn2002, Dunn2004}.
It was suggested by increasing the presence of Tregs in terms of suppression of Th1 and cytotoxic T cells response by \acrfull{ctla4} \citep{Halvorsen2014}.
Moreover, myelo-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, CD34+) could also down-regulation of granzyme from T cells in \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Si2019}.
The antitumoral effect of adaptive immunity also help to the tumour evolution. It lets tumour cells to modify immunogenicity to avoid immune recognition, and to resist the cytotoxicity of T cells.
The activated oncogenes can trigger 1) DNA-damage sensors, [such as ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3 related)]; 2) checkpoint kinases, [such as CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1 homologue) and CHK2]; 3) and the tumour-suppressor protein p53. 
The transcription factor, p53, that is activated by many genotoxic insults and induces cellular apoptosis. The gene TP53, encoding p53, is frequently mutated or functionally inactivated in cancer cells.
Through suppression of the DNA-damage response by above mechanisms, tumor cells might downregulation of NKG2D ligands (\acrshort{mica}, \acrshort{micb}) to avoid recognition by NKG2D-expressing NK cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, $\gamma\delta$ T cells and some cytolytic CD8+ $\alpha\beta$ T cells \citep{Ljunggren2007}. They also express PD‐L1 and Fas ligand to suppress cytotoxic T cells \citep{Zitvogel2006}. Thus, the cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis (aka. DNA-damage response) of tumor cells will be inhibited.
The activation of $\acrshort{tgf}\beta$ in terms of promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
%IL-10
% Activation of the DNA-damage response by cell-intrinsic stimuli (oncogene activation or reactive oxygen species, ROS) or therapy activates the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)–CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1 homologue) pathway. This pathway leads either to p53- or NKG2D- (ligand: MICA or MICB) dependent apoptosis of tumour cells.
% NKG2D (Natural-killer group 2, member D). A lectin-type activating receptor that is encoded by the NK complex and is expressed at the surface of NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells and some cytolytic CD8+ αβ T cells. 
% The ligands for NKG2D are MHC-class-I-polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MICB in humans; and retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAE1) and H60 in mice

% 小巷弄防巷戰 (金門防線)
Finally, tumor cells have downregulated homing receptors, and malformation of peripheral vacularity. It causes hypoxia and increased interstitial pressure which lead to a hostile microenvironment for against the infiltrating defense cells \citep{Ljunggren2007}.

Evasion of apoptosis contributes to the acquisition of initial oncogenesis, resistance to chemotherapy and to immune effectors
The apoptotic program is carried out through two main pathways: the mitochondrial pathway, which involves mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP)61; and the death-receptor pathway, which involves ligation of a plasma-membrane receptor, leading to the formation of a death-inducing signalling complex (DISC).

% a long way to go becoming cancer
Chronic inflammation is a risk factor in promoting carcinogenesis. The persistent inflammation in oral lichen planus (with reticular striations) was found that the influx of T helper, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells were increased in oral mucosa with moderate to severe dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to normal or mild dysplasia \citep{Gannot2002}. The infiltration of T cells and dendritic cells were also found in oral lichen planus \citep{Lorenzini2013}.
The incidence of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus is approximately 0.5–1.5\% \citep{Bermejo-Fenoll2009}, while oral leukoplakia is about 10\%.

After establishing a therapeutic relationship (TR), the physicians' spiritual properties (empathy, sympathy, and compassion) will engage their patients and recover their self-compassion to gain resilience against the disease through their mind-brain-body axis.
Thus, we suggest electric healthcare records (EHR) include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information. The \acrshort{tcga} should collect "holistic features" as well (\textcolor{green}{green} dashed line).}

A systematic review of spiritually based interventions and psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcomes in breast cancer survivorship was reported by Hulett et al.\cite{Hulett2016}. 
%Objective This is a review of spiritually based interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction, MBSR) that utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought to examine the evidence regarding relationships between spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer survivors. 
%Methods A systematic search of 9 online databases was conducted for articles of original research, peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer selected questions regarding relationships between psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized in spiritually based interventions. Implications for future spiritually based interventions in breast cancer survivorship are discussed. Results Twenty-two articles were reviewed.

Psychosocial stress is associated with cancer incidence and poor survival\cite{Chida2008}.
These impacts might be mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\cite{Hsiao2012}.
Thus, cortisol is one of the most common (objective) outcomes studied in PNI factors. % others: interleukin, cytokines, lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+), CD56+, vitals signs, telomere length, telomere activity, HRV
The standardized, psychosocial (subjective) measures include depression, stress, quality of life, anxiety, fatigue, mindfulness, mood, and specific spiritual growth (i.e., the meaning of life)\cite{Hsiao2012}. %  body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy in the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ) including two sub-scales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search.
% The MLQ [15] for measuring psychological well-being consists of two subscales: the 5-item MLQ-Presence subscale, measuring the subjective sense that one’s life is meaningful, and the 5-item MLQ-Search subscale, measuring the drive and orientation toward finding meaning in one’s life.
%Compared with control groups, intervention groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although limitations exist. %Design methods have improved with regard to increased use of comparison groups compared with previous reviews. There are few spiritually based interventions that specifically measure religious or spiritual constructs. Similarly, there are few existing studies that utilize standardized religious or spiritual measures with PNI outcome measures. 
Findings suggest that mindfulness meditation could stabilize neuroendocrine-immune activity (measured by PNI biomarkers) in breast cancer patients comparing to control groups\cite{Hulett2016}.
%This review revealed a positive pattern between spiritually-based interventions and several PNI biomarker outcomes, suggesting that spiritually-based interventions offer positive mental and physiological health benefits. 
%For breast cancer survivors, these studies suggested that engaging in spiritually-based practices may improve or stabilize the immune profile dysregulation that occurs with breast cancer.\cite{Hulett2016}.
%From a PNI perspective, future spiritually based interventions should include standardized measures of religiousness and spirituality in order to understand relationships between and among religiousness, spirituality, and neuroendocrine-immune outcomes. Future research should now focus on determining the minimum dose and duration needed to improve or stabilize neuroendocrine-immune function, as well as

%Mindfulness based stress reduction provides psychological benefit and restores immune function of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer: A randomized trial with active control.
%BACKGROUND: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer experience psychological distress, accompanied by reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) and altered levels of cytokines, which may compromise cancer control. Few studies have evaluated psycho-immune outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in comparison to an active control condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether MBSR benefits psychological, behavioral, and immunological function in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: After confirmation of breast cancer staging, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (n = 192) were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or an 8-week active control condition (ACC). The ACC consisted of a series of cancer recovery and health education classes. Both MBSR and the ACC were administered in group format. METHODS: Women completed psychometric instruments and provided blood for NKCA and cytokine levels at pre-, mid-, and completion of program, as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. One hundred and twenty four women completed all five-assessments (MBSR, n = 63; ACC, n = 61). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze trajectories of outcomes over time and between groups. 
%RESULTS: Compared to the ACC group, women randomized to MBSR exhibited decreasing trajectories of perceived stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms. 
%Further, compared to women randomized to ACC, MBSR women exhibited trajectories demonstrating significantly more rapid restoration of NKCA, accompanied by 
%lower circulating TNF-alpha levels, lower IL-6 production =>  pro-inflammatory cytokines
%and greater IFN-gamma production => IFN gamma supports an immune-mediated response against cancer and this may be important during the transition following cancer treatment
A randomized clinical trial with active control proved that early provision of MBSR for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer provides psychological benefits (reduction of stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms), and also optimizes immune functions (higher natural killer cell activity, higher \acrshort{ifng}, lower TNF-alpha, lower IL-6) supportive of cancer survival\cite{WitekJanusek2019}.



%%%% PCA and ECA: the way to delivery of MBSR
The therapeutic relationship (TR) is essential towards spiritual care.
According to clinical experience in healthcare, sometimes patients could tell the physicians: "How amazing it is. I want to talk about myself more when I visit this doctor whom I trust."
In 1979, Carl Rogers wrote\cite{Rogers1979}: "I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then whatever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful."
Carl Rogers developed person-centered theory that the therapist is providing the appropriate social-environmental conditions for their patients\cite{Rogers1957}\cite{Joseph2004}\cite{Griffiths2013}.
Person-centred theory holds that the innate tendency towards growth and development is facilitated by the six conditions described by Rogers in 1957\cite{Rogers1957}:\\
%For constructive personality change to occur, it is necessary that these conditions exist and continue over a period of time: 
1. Two persons are in psychological contact. \\
2. The first, whom we shall term the client, is in a state of incongruence (or not harmony), being vulnerable or anxious. \\
3. The second person, whom we shall term the therapist, is congruent
or integrated with the relationship. \\
4. The therapist experiences "unconditional positive regard" for the client. \\
5. The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's
internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experience to the client. \\
6. The communication to the client of the therapist's empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard is to a minimal degree achieved.\\

%As a person with hemophilia (PWH), my passion led me to conduct personal research to uncover the main cause of my drawbacks in my education, my career, and my romantic life. I have experienced unjustified conflicts in my social relations, feeling stale in mind and body
%Findings: Through my research, I uncovered that I used to suffer from what I call 'mind inhibitors' these were the hidden cause of my life disorders and spontaneous bleeds. These mind inhibitors are responsible for locking the body factor receptors, blocking body energy centres (like the solar plexus), discouraging the super-intelligent body cells from running their auto-healing system, and paralyzing the instinctive high-speed cellular response to external molecular treatment. 
%Mind inhibitors originate from different sources like thinking of oneself in a victim role, anxiety about medical treatments, lack of financial stability, negative attitudes, self-rejection, and contradictory thoughts and feelings. 
%Conclusion: Mind inhibitors should be handled as seriously as biological inhibitors. As Dr. Bruce Lipton explains in his book, 'The Biology of Belief'\cite{Lipton2015}: DNA does not control our biology; instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell. Our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking, since thoughts are made of energy that affects the cellular energy level, and thus everything is created twice: once in our minds and then the physical creation follows. % 萬法唯心造
Holistic healthcare should be considered for treating patients as a complete synchronized system of soul, mind, and body; treatment should include more than medication or surgery, but a holistic approach would also address the patient's need for a subconscious paradigm shift in the person's thought and belief system.\cite{Kobisi2012}\cite{Lipton2015}

Cullen studied the objective science of analytical chemistry. He also studied that the patient's therapeutic response could be influenced by his

%Cullen developed a theory of "sympathy" (or empathy) which informed his ideas about clinical medicine dealing with the psychosomatic theory of illness and mind-body therapeutics. % he do 炮製

%This finely calibrated, rational use of active placebo treatment, in which the physician-dispensed weak, physiologically active substance in order to please and calm the patient rather than to cure the patient's underlying disorder, was a product of the rational scientific culture of the 18th century Scottish Enlightenment and its embrace of a grounded, empirical approach to medicine. %啟蒙運動

Moreover, long-term stress could be correlated with cancer metastasis\cite{Lutgendorf2010}\cite{Moreno-Smith2010}\cite{Du2020}\cite{Xu2021},
and cancer initiation\cite{Lutgendorf2010}\cite{Powell2013}\cite{Iftikhar2021}.(see Figure \ref{fig:figure5}) %HNSCC
Adverse psychosocial experiences in early life, such as child maltreatment, caregiver stress, and community violence, have been associated in epidemiological studies with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancers, and psychiatric illnesses. 
The possible molecular mechanisms could be also related with the mind-brain-body axis\cite{Berens2017}.
%Additional work has shed light on the potential molecular mechanisms by which early adversity becomes "biologically embedded" in altered physiology across body systems.\cite{Berens2017}

%% TCGA new holistic features %%%%%
Our current \acrshort{hnscc} study summarizes that six candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors.
The prognosis model with coefficients is established from \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort. The important input $X_1...X_n$ should be patients' features: age, specific six gene expressions, clinical T stage, and surgical margin so far.
When we consider the survival prediction model in holistic manner,
ground truth Y (e.x. patient's survival):\\[0.5cm]
%Y$:\\[0.3cm]
$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$\\[0.5cm]
Gene expression is not an independent $X_{mrna}$. It could be correlated with other (for example)\\ $X_{body}, X_{stress}, X_{fear}, X_{meaningOfLife}, X_{inflammation}, X_{empathy}$ factors.\\
There is much work to be done in investigating the functional network more fully\cite{Rogers1959}.
%We wish the TCGA does collect more holistic features from their participants in the future.

We suggest TCGA should cover more holistic features:
cortisol is one of the most common objective outcomes studied in psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) factor, interleukin, cytokines, lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+), CD56+, vitals signs, telomere length, telomere activity, and heart rate variability (HRV).
The standardized, psychosocial (subjective) measures include depression, stress, quality of life, anxiety, fatigue, mindfulness, mood, and specific spiritual growth (i.e., the meaning of life)\cite{Hsiao2012}.

Since psychological benefit (reduction of stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms) also optimizes immune function (higher natural killer cell activity, higher \acrshort{ifng}, lower TNF-alpha, lower IL-6) in terms of better survival of cancer patients.

% holistic EHR
Moreover, we encourage physicians to write their electric healthcare record (EHR) in a "holistic way".
% Deep Patient:  
Deep learning can convert EHR to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format\cite{Rajkomar2018}\cite{HealthLevelSeven2019} for handling free-text notes by physicians.
Deep learning can also derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions\cite{Miotto2016}.

Once the holistic feature is available, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) is mandatory for further survival analysis\cite{Ching2018a}.

\section*{Preliminary Results}
In our previous proteomics studies\cite{Tai2007}, identification of the differentially expressed proteins in \acrshort{hnscc} could be helped by the analyses of \acrfull{lcms} and \acrfull{maldi}. \acrshort{maldi} analysis could capture samples from the surface of \acrshort{hnscc} specimen and generate two-dimensional ion density maps of those molecules, primarily peptides or proteins. The maps give the relative abundance of the molecules with their spatial distribution.
We also applied the \acrshort{maldi} to analyze paired (N) normal and (T) tumor samples from \acrshort{hnscc}, as well as \acrshort{lcms} analysis in \acrshort{hnscc} cell lines to identify tumor-associated biomarkers. 
Our results from the proteomics study showed several proteins found to be over-expressed in advanced \acrshort{hnscc}. 
We identified that \acrfull{tmsb4x} is one of the most significant candidatescite{Chi2017}. Higher \acrshort{tmsb4x} expression in the tumor was validated by evaluating N/T-paired \acrshort{hnscc} samples at both RNA and protein levels. Overexpression of \acrshort{tmsb4x} is significantly associated with poor prognosis of \acrshort{os} and \acrfull{rfs} in \acrshort{hnscc} patients. The silencing of \acrshort{tmsb4x} expression in the \acrshort{hnscc} cell line reduced the proliferation and invasion ability in vitro and inhibited the cervical lymph node metastasis in vivo. 
\acrshort{tmsb4x} could affect enhanced proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo of \acrshort{hnscc} by the animal study.

The 9416 Kaplan-Meier plots with associated Cox's univariate and multivariate tables were generated by Cox modeling (see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}) and justified by the ranking of hazard ratios.
The 967 genes were kept by criteria of uncorrected \textit{P} value (below 0.05) and \acrfull{hr} (greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5) (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(a) univariate, and Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(b) multivariate plots). 
At the final step, a stringent criteria (Bonferroni \textit{P} value correction) was used to yield twenty candidates (see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(c), (d)). 
% before validation
Among these candidates, ten overexpressed genes (symbol as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of  \acrshort{os} (see Table \ref{table:table1}). 
The other ten overexpressed genes (symbol as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival (see Table \ref{table:table3}, with their gene name).
We made a volcano plot for 9416 genes by Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value (less than 0.05, obtained during cutoff finding procedure) against the Cox hazard ratio (see Figure \ref{fig:figure3}). The plot reveals that the most significant (Bonferroni-adjusted \textit{P} $< 0.05$) candidate genes are located above the dotted line. At the same time, Cox's HR separated them on the two-side with prognostic impact.
% => after validation: The result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

After the discovery by our workflow, we validated the those 20 genes in the other independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837).
The survival significance (Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value) is in the following probes among 10 genes:\\
1) poor prognosis: CAMK2N1 (0.048214), PGK1 (0.009978), SURF4 (0.023127), USP10 (0.017768), NDFIP1 (0.022758), FOXA2 (0.001587);\\ % FOXA2 (0.038125)
2) better prognosis: IL19 (0.049731), FCGBP (0.005658), KIAA1683 (IQCN, 0.005886), NPB (0.014177);\\
%17 out of 20 candidates
%?DKK1 (0.253635), 
%Nevertheless, PrognoScan has group separation cut by a skewed manner, and the GSE2837 has far fewer participants than the TCGA cohort.

%ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, KIAA1683 (IQCN), NPB
%Those 11 genes achieve similar positive and negative prognostic effect comparable with our proposed candidate genes. 
Thus, these 10 candidates have been confirmed by a comparative study using the GSE2837 dataset other than the TCGA cohort. Please see Kaplan-Meier plots in Supplementary Figure S1.%\ref{fig:fig_GSE2837}.

After validated by GSE2837, our top 1 candidate is \acrfull{CAMK2N1}. The Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 152 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{CAMK2N1} were suffered from only 35\% of 5-year \acrshort{os} rate. In comparison, the other 262 patients with lower expression (the cutoff at 0.027(RSEM)) had a better prognosis (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$) (see Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(a)).
Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(b)'s cumulative \textit{P} value plot shows that the uncorrected 147 \textit{P} values ($< 0.05$) have been estimated by a serial cut from 144 to 290 persons for grouping the cohort in our cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R, see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, cutoff engine). The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{2.97e-7}), when cut on n=262 (63.3\% of 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value.
Conversely, the most associated gene with better survival is \acrfull{IL19}. In Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(c), a Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 215 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{IL19} had 60\% of 5-year OS survival rate (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$). The cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R) generated cumulative \textit{P} value plot in Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(d). The 161 uncorrected \textit{P} values were estimated by a serial cut from 125 to 286 for grouping the cohort. The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{3.73e-7}), when cut on n=199 (48.1\% of total cohort 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value with a cutoff value -0.147(RSEM) of \acrshort{rnaseq}.
%The second candidate, which improving patient survival, is ZNF266.

Table \ref{table:table1} shows ten overexpressed genes are associated with poor prognosis in \acrshort{hnscc}, ranked by adjusted Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value.
Six out of ten genes has been validated by using GSE2837.
We found those six candidates have the Cox's univariate and multivariate HR above 1.914.
%There were few published articles of \acrfull{SURF4} and \acrfull{NDFIP1} (\acrshort{NEDD4}: \acrlong{NEDD4}), which were related to cancer research.
In Table \ref{table:table2}, % table 3
after adjustment of confounders, \acrshort{CAMK2N1} overexpression is the independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR 2.007 [95\% CI: 1.490-2.704, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]), as well as clinical T stage (HR 1.982 [95\% CI: 1.048-3.745, \textit{P} = 0.035]) and surgical margins status (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.182-2.250, \textit{P} = 0.003]). 
Older age (more than 65) also worse the survival (HR 1.391 [95\% CI: 1.025-1.888, \textit{P} = 0.034]). 
The M stage could be ignored in this cohort due to only 3 out of 414 patients with distant metastasis.

In Table \ref{table:table3}, the other ten overexpressed genes have been found in better prognosis of \acrshort{hnscc} patients. Cox's univariate and multivariate HR is under 0.5.
Four out of ten has been validated by using GSE2837.
In Table \ref{table:table4},
after adjustment of confounders, prognosis is influenced by advance clinical T Status (HR 1.961 [95\% CI: 1.035-3.714, \textit{P} = 0.039] ), positive surgical margin involvement (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.18-2.254, \textit{P} = 0.003]) , and higher tobacco exposure (HR 1.453 [95\% CI: 1.055-2.000, \textit{P} = 0.022]).
Overexpressed \acrshort{IL19} gene could has a protective influencce on prognosis (HR 0.499 [95\% CI: 0.372-0.669, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]).


In summary, those ten candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc}.
Thus, the prognosis model with coefficients is established from \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort. 
%The important input $X_1...X_n$ should be patients' features: age, specific ten gene expressions, clinical T stage, and surgical margin.

% After validation with an independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837), the result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. 
%Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

%1.本計畫採用之研究方法與原因。2.預計可能遭遇之困難及解決途徑 fallback approaches
% ***執行的策略
% 科技部鼓勵研究主題的系統性，也鼓勵具研究能力者從事較大型但 可能是較困難的長期研究。在建立研究架構的同時，要審慎考慮如何適當分配 每一年的執行進度。例如，容易有具體成果的部分可能要先放在前面作為基 礎，較困難的部分便可以逐年按部就班地進行調查分析。

Specific Aims %特定研究目標 (specific aims), 執行策略不能互相綁在一起, go paralleling, and equally balanced

Aim 1: Construct a Deep Learning Platform of TCIA Survival Analysis
central issue 1 with preliminary data (key data); fallback approaches %先以概要式的背景介紹破題，點出研究目標的重要性，然後用邏輯之陳述將如何達成目標的策略和方法講清楚。請務必注意：每個研究目標基本上需具備其獨立性 (Independence)，但其重要性卻要在目標之間有所連結，且要能回應總體目標之研究顯著性
We further plan to develop a deep-learning based data mining as well as validation platform. It might incorporate whole slide images of pathology from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and Taipei Medical University (TMU) biobank.
%RNA-Seq data of \acrfull{tcga} for survival analysis.

Recurrent neural network (RNN) will deal with "holistic features" from electric healthcare records (EHR) of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH).
These patient's features should include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information investigated by physicians.


Aim 3: RNA-Seq Incorporated with Whole-slide Images models from TCIA and TMU
central issue 3 without preliminary data; fallback approaches
Whole-slide Images models are the surrogate of expression data of RNA-Seq

Aim 4: Biomarkers Discovery from RNA-Seq, Whole-slide Images, and EHR from TCGA and TMU biobank
