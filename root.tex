\begin{abstract}


\textbf{Background:}
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (\acrshort{hnscc}) represents a significant health concern worldwide. Surgery and systemic therapy are still the standard of care for \acrshort{hnscc} patients. The break-through improvement of those interventions should depend on 1) the discovery of high impact prognostic biomarkers, and 2) proper treatment planning by accurate sub-population of those patients.
The survival analysis of the \acrfull{tcga} dataset is a well-known method to discover the gene expression-based biomarkers of \acrshort{hnscc}. It is necessary to determine a cutoff point of the patients' dichotomization in survival analysis with the continuous gene expression measurements. There is some optimization software for cutoff mining.
However, the software's determination of cutoffs is usually set at the median, 1/4 quantile, or 3/4 quantile of \acrfull{rnaseq} value to find a significant \textit{P} value by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. There are few clinicopathological or spiritual features available on their pre-processed data sets.
The survival analysis could conclude the manifest of clinical, pathological, and transcriptomics data to find the prognostic biomarkers.

%Methods: how the study was performed and statistical tests used
\textbf{Methods:}
R script was used to develop a comprehensive workflow, named "pvalueTex", running on the Rstudio platform. It includes data retrieving and pre-processing, feature selection, cutoff mining engine, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox proportional hazard modeling to discover prognostic biomarkers.
We further plan to develop a deep-learning based data mining as well as validation platform. It might incorporate whole-slide images of pathology from the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) and Taipei Medical University (TMU) biobank.
%RNA-Seq data of \acrfull{tcga} for survival analysis. 
Convolutional neural network (CNN) will be used for feature extraction from whole-slide images.
Recurrent neural network (RNN) will deal with "holistic features" from electric healthcare records (EHR) of Taipei Medical University Hospital (TMUH).
These patient's features should include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information investigated by physicians.

% Results: the main findings
\textbf{Preliminary Results:}
Using pvalueTex on the \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort, we scanned human protein-coding genes (20,500) programmatically. After adjustment with other confounders, we found that the clinical tumor stage and the surgical margin involvement are independent risk factors in patient survival. 
According to the resulting tables with Bonferroni adjusted \textit{P} value under optimal cutoff as well as hazard ratio $(>=1.5)$, there were ten candidate biomarkers, named as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1, which are significantly associated with the poor prognosis of \acrfull{os}. At the same time, the other ten genes were over-expressed in the better survival patients (with hazard ratio $<=0.5$), named as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN (previous name as KIAA1683), and NPB.

% Conclusions: brief summary and potential implications
\textbf{Conclusions:}
%Those 11 validated biomarkers (DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, NDFIP1, STIP1, DKC1, ZNF557, ZNF266, and FCGBP), 
The candidate biomarkers, clinical tumor size, and surgical margin status are suggested prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc} through TCGA analysis.
The transcriptomic representation of \acrfull{tcia} and TCGA could be applied to validate those candidates by independent TMU cohort (n=46, obtained at TMU Joint Biobank).
We conclude that expression data of \acrshort{rnaseq} with associated pathological images and holistic features will help to facilitate the biomarker discovery in terms of tumor-agnostic therapy.

頭頸部鱗狀細胞癌數位病理影像與全人照護電子病歷的深度學習\\[0.3cm]

頭頸部鱗狀細胞癌 (\acrfull{hnscc}) 在全世界都是重要的健康問題。手術、放射治療和全身性治療(化療、免疫)仍然是這些患者的標準治療方式。要如何有突破性的發展，取決於發掘有效的預後生物標記，以分群來制定精準治療計劃。
利用\acrfull{tcga}資料庫的生存分析，是找尋頭頸部鱗狀細胞癌生物標記最常用的方法。
我們已使用R語言開發命名為"pvalueTex"的程式(可在Rstudio server 平台執行)，功能包括數據檢索、資料處理、特徵選擇、資料挖礦引擎、Kaplan-Meier 存活分析、Cox比例風險模型，以用來系統性大規模搜尋預後生物標記。
我們接下來計劃開發深度學習(Deep Learning)數據挖掘和驗證平台。使用癌症數位病理影像(\acrfull{tcia}, 已與TCGA串連)，及臺北醫學大學(TMU) 生物資料庫的46名口腔癌個案，在取得H\&E病理切片數位掃描檔後，配合臺北醫學大學附屬醫院電子病歷，以AI人工智慧演算法，來做存活分析。
%它包含來自癌症影像檔案 (TCIA) 和臺北醫學大學 (TMU) 生物資料庫的病理學全幻燈片圖像。
%\acrfull{tcga} 的 %RNA-Seq 數據用於生存分析。
深度學習的卷積神經網絡(\acrfull{cnn})可由數位病理影像中提取特徵。
而循環神經網絡(\acrfull{rnn})將處理電子病歷的"全人照護特徵"。
這些患者的特徵應該包括身體、病理、心理狀態，社會關係，甚至全人照顧醫師所紀錄的靈性紀錄。\\
結論：

\section{Biological Hallmarks of Cancer}

The multi-step process of genetic alteration is contributing to the development of cancer. The accumulation of mutation, amplification, or chromosomal aberrations in proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes might be the consequence of the stimulation from intrinsic or extrinsic environments.
Since cancer cells acquired the ten biological hallmarks, these functional capabilities consist of sustaining proliferative signaling and evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, activating invasion with metastasis, deregulating cellular energetics and metabolism, avoiding immune destruction, tumor-promoting inflammation, and genome instability and mutation \citep{Hanahan2000, Hanahan2011, Hanahan2017}. The tumor micro-environment, which is composed of cancer cells and tumor‐associated fibroblasts, infiltrating immune cells, and angiogenic vascular cells.

\end{outline}

The concept that cancer cells alter their utilization of energy sources—notably glucose—to support their proliferation was introduced almost 90 years ago by Otto Warburg, who observed that certain cultured-cancer cells have enhanced uptake of glucose, which is metabolized via glycolysis, even in the presence of oxygen levels that normally should favor oxidative phosphorylation.

In our previous work\citep{Chang2017b}, the Warburg effect promotes the progression of \acrshort{hnscc}, which is partially attributed to the \acrlong{slc2a4} (\acrshort{slc2a4}, or \acrlong{glut4}, \acrshort{glut4}) and \acrfull{trim24} pathway\citep{Chang2017b}\citep{Mani2020}.

\section{Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma}
\label{sec:section}

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), which is derived from the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx and larynx, is the sixth common cancer worldwide \citep{Siegel2016}, as well as the fourth leading cancer causes of death for males in Taiwan\citep{MOHW_death2017}. The age-standardized incidence rate of \acrshort{hnscc} in males is 42.43 per 100,000 persons\citep{MOHW_incidence2018}. The mortality rate of HNSCC patients in the male is 11.1-fold greater than that in women.


%  Patients with early-stage cancer often manifest minimal physical evidence, which usually ignored by themselves, resulting in delayed diagnosis regarding poor tumor control and patient survival. Therefore, quitting bad habits, routine screening in high-risk population and early intervention will be helpful to improve their survival while maintaining the quality of life. 


\subsection{Etiology}
The main risk factors for HNSCC include carcinogens in tobacco and betel nut, alcohol, oncogenic viruses.
In Asian population, \acrfull{aldh2} mutation plays a very important rule to enhance HNSCC\citep{Chien2019} by alcohol consumption.
The oncogenic viruses such as \acrfull{hpv} and Epstein–Barr virus play a major carcinogenic role in tumors of the oropharynx and nasopharynx, respectively\citep{Ferrarotto2017}.
Moreover, physical irritations, ionized radiation and host susceptibility may also contribute to the etiology of HNSCC\citep{Ko1995,Znaori2003} (Figure \ref{fig:DAG_etiology}).
Primary prevention by minimizing exposure to known carcinogens is promising, but limited success is achieved due to addiction, economic, social or spiritual issues.

\subsection{Conventional Treatment}


%The modern treatment of HNSCC should be done by surgery alone, radiation therapy alone, or a combination of them with adjuvant chemotherapy according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines \citep{Pfishter2019}. Despite those interventions, the 5-year survival rate for this disease has improved only marginally over the past decade, and recurrent disease is observed in ~50\% of all patients \citep{Forastiere2001,Warnakulasuriya2009}. By comparison with new systemic treatments seen in other solid tumours, the prognostic result of targeted therapy, ex. EGFR inhibitors, in HNSCC patients has remained relatively stationary in recent years. \citep{Argiris2015a}. 
%%

% chemotherapy => systemic therapy
The treatment strategies of HNSCC are surgery alone, systemic therapy with concurrent radiation therapy (systemic therapy/RT), or surgery with adjuvant systemic therapy/RT (according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network, NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in HNSCC, Version 2.2020) \citep{Pfister2020a}. Despite the improvement in those interventions, the survival of HNSCC has improved only marginally over the past decade worldwide \citep{hpa2019}.
The recurrent disease is still observed in up to 50\% of all patients \citep{Forastiere2001,Warnakulasuriya2009}.
By comparison with new systemic treatments seen in other solid tumours, the prognostic result of targeted therapy, ex. EGFR inhibitors, in HNSCC patients has remained relatively stationary since it's available\citep{Argiris2015a}.
The critical advancement of immuno-oncology should benefit from emerging prognostic biomarkers, which guide the development of modern systemic therapy.

%%Oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer account for more than 7000 deaths annually, with an annual incidence of more than 30,000 new cases within the United States. 1  Worldwide it is the sixth most common malignancy, with incidence varying greatly among different geographic locations. Its prevalence can range from countries with rates similar to those in the United States, to countries such as India, where death from oral cavity cancer is one of the top three forms of cancer death. As well in Taiwan, HNSCC is one of the top four forms of cancer death.

%\subsection{??Prognostic Biomarkers guide the Treatment of \acrshort{hnscc}}
%A biomarker can be either predictive or prognostic. A predictive marker predicts benefit from a specific treatment; it helps to select a particular treatment over another. A prognostic marker predicts the natural history of disease (survival), independent of treatment. It can indicate a need for further treatment, but does not help to determine which treatment.The key advancement of those interventions should be i) the discovery of high impact diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers, ii) and planning of the proper treatment modalities for accurate sub-grouped HNSCC patients.
%The ROC Plotter is the first online transcriptome-level validation tool for predictive biomarkers.

%The management of head and neck malignancies is site and histology specific, and requires a multidisciplinary team approach.

%\subsubsection{Medical Oncology for \acrshort{hnscc}}



\subsection{Immunotherapy for \acrshort{hnscc}}
Modern Systemic Therapy is guided by biomarkers.
%Immune Response in \acrshort{hnscc}
%Cancer Immunotherapy
The basic principles that guide cancer Immunotherapy are immune surveillance, immune editing, and immune tolerance\citep{Sharma2017}, involving immune-checkpoint molecules.
%Figure15_cite_Ferrarotto2017.png
Until the immuno-oncology era, \acrfull{ici} was introduced since 2014 for treating \acrshort{hnscc}\citep{Seiwert2014}\citep{Swanson2015}.
The \acrshort{ici} works on immune checkpoint molecules, including \acrfull{pd1}, \acrfull{ctla4}, \acrfull{tim3}, \acrfull{lag3}, \acrfull{tigit}, \acrfull{gitr}, and \acrfull{vista}\citep{Mei2020}.
The \acrshort{us} \acrshort{fda} has approved the anti-\acrshort{pd1} agents (e.g. pembrolizumab and nivolumab) as a monotherapy for the platinum-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic \acrshort{hnscc}\citep{Cramer2019}. 
According to the phase 3 KEYNOTE-048 study, \acrshort{pdl1} is a validated biomarker used in clinical guidance for candidate selection of pembrolizumab\citep{Burtness2019}\citep{Gavrielatou2020}.
However, because of the complexity of immune-tumor interaction, \acrshort{ici} has 20\% response rate to \acrfull{pdl1} expressed patients (over 50\% in \acrlong{ihc}, \acrshort{ihc} staining of \acrshort{hnscc})\citep{Swanson2015}\citep{Gavrielatou2020}.

Currently, Pembrolizumab and nivolumab's success is also based on a common biomarker (e.g., \acrshort{pd1}) crossing several types of cancer.
It shows a model of tumor type-agnostic therapy\citep{Yan2018}.
%*** PD-L1/PD-L2 is a biomarker; Keynote-012
There are several common biomarkers of \acrfull{ici} under evaluation, including \acrfull{til}, \acrfull{ifng}, and \acrfull{tmb}\citep{Gavrielatou2020}.
The other \acrshort{ici}, anti-\acrshort{lag3} (pelatlimab), is currently evaluated under the phase I/IIA\citep{Cristina2019} (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01968109) and II-IVA\citep{Neal2019} (NCT04080804) studies.

such as age, gender, residual tumor, vital status, days\_to\_last\_followup, cancer stage, smoking duration, exposure to alcohol, asbestos, radioactive radon. 
However, the TCGA did not collect other features from holistic cancer care.

Going for holistic cancer care\citep{Mehta2019}\citep{Iftikhar2021} spiritual and emotional condition is equally essential comparing with physical and social status (see Figure \ref{fig:figure5}).

%
World Health Organisation has called worldwide for delivering people-centred (or person-centred) care from the physical, emotional, socioeconomic, and spiritual perspectives\citep{WHO2015}\citep{Ling-ChengMong2021}.
Core principles can be taken to achieve people-centred and integrated health service delivery. 
The first principle is holistic – focusing on physical, socioeconomic, mental, and emotional well-being. 
Holistic care has been defined that care and sees the person as a whole with psychological, social, and environmental levels of needs and goals.
%that considers  factors rather than just the symptoms of disease or ill-health.

%The second principle is empowering – supporting people to manage and take responsibility for their health,
%Empowerment: the process of supporting people and communities to take control of their own health needs resulting, 
%for example, in the uptake of healthier behaviors or the ability to self-manage illnesses.
%People-centred care requires that people have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their care.

%Glossary:
%People-centred care: an approach to care that consciously adopts individuals’, carers’, families’ and communities’ perspectives as participants in, and beneficiaries of, trusted health systems that respond to their needs and preferences in humane and holistic ways. People-centred care also requires that people have the education and support they need to make decisions and participate in their own care. It is organized around the health needs and expectations of people rather than diseases (7,8) 
%Person-centred care: care approaches and practices that see the person as a whole with many levels of needs and goals, with these needs coming from their own personal social determinants of health.

\bcaption{The concept of holistic care for \acrshort{hnscc} patients.}
{\\Beyond carcinogenesis - Under the mind-brain-body axis, a stressful environment (giant \textcolor{black}{black} arrow) will trigger emotional reception. The subconscious mind (brain) will release stress hormones and inflammation signals in response to the emotion. The physical body's internal environment (cells) alters epigenetic control in gene regulation and mRNA expression. In a long incubation time, the tissue/cells will be transformed into dysplasia then malignancy (e.x. HNSCC) with helping from known carcinogens.\\
Cancer care - Holistic care should take care of cancer patients' spiritual, emotional, physical, and socioeconomic needs. Physical care will be carried out by medication therapy or surgery. After establishing a therapeutic relationship (TR), the physicians' spiritual properties (empathy, sympathy, and compassion) will engage their patients and recover their self-compassion to gain resilience against the disease through their mind-brain-body axis.
Thus, we suggest electric healthcare records (EHR) include physical, pathological, psychological data, and even more spiritual information. The \acrshort{tcga} should collect "holistic features" as well (\textcolor{green}{green} dashed line).}

A systematic review of spiritually based interventions and psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcomes in breast cancer survivorship was reported by Hulett et al.\citep{Hulett2016}. 
%Objective This is a review of spiritually based interventions (eg, mindfulness-based stress reduction, MBSR) that utilized psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) outcome measures in breast cancer survivors. Specifically, this review sought to examine the evidence regarding relationships between spiritually based interventions, psychosocial-spiritual outcomes, and biomarker outcomes in breast cancer survivors. 
%Methods A systematic search of 9 online databases was conducted for articles of original research, peer-reviewed, randomized and nonrandomized control trials from 2005-2015. Data were extracted in order to answer selected questions regarding relationships between psychosocial-spiritual and physiological measures utilized in spiritually based interventions. Implications for future spiritually based interventions in breast cancer survivorship are discussed. Results Twenty-two articles were reviewed. 
%mindfulness-based cancer recovery (MBCR) 
Psychosocial stress is associated with cancer incidence and poor survival\citep{Chida2008}.
These impacts might be mediated through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis\citep{Hsiao2012}.
Thus, cortisol is one of the most common (objective) outcomes studied in PNI factors. % others: interleukin, cytokines, lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+), CD56+, vitals signs, telomere length, telomere activity, HRV
The standardized, psychosocial (subjective) measures include depression, stress, quality of life, anxiety, fatigue, mindfulness, mood, and specific spiritual growth (i.e., the meaning of life)\citep{Hsiao2012}. %  body-mind-spirit (BMS) group therapy in the Meaning in Life questionnaire (MLQ) including two sub-scales: MLQ-Presence and MLQ-Search.
% The MLQ [15] for measuring psychological well-being consists of two subscales: the 5-item MLQ-Presence subscale, measuring the subjective sense that one’s life is meaningful, and the 5-item MLQ-Search subscale, measuring the drive and orientation toward finding meaning in one’s life.
%Compared with control groups, intervention groups demonstrated positive mental health outcomes and improved or stable neuroendocrine-immune profiles, although limitations exist. %Design methods have improved with regard to increased use of comparison groups compared with previous reviews. There are few spiritually based interventions that specifically measure religious or spiritual constructs. Similarly, there are few existing studies that utilize standardized religious or spiritual measures with PNI outcome measures. 
Findings suggest that mindfulness meditation could stabilize neuroendocrine-immune activity (measured by PNI biomarkers) in breast cancer patients comparing to control groups\citep{Hulett2016}.
%This review revealed a positive pattern between spiritually-based interventions and several PNI biomarker outcomes, suggesting that spiritually-based interventions offer positive mental and physiological health benefits. 
%For breast cancer survivors, these studies suggested that engaging in spiritually-based practices may improve or stabilize the immune profile dysregulation that occurs with breast cancer.\citep{Hulett2016}.
%From a PNI perspective, future spiritually based interventions should include standardized measures of religiousness and spirituality in order to understand relationships between and among religiousness, spirituality, and neuroendocrine-immune outcomes. Future research should now focus on determining the minimum dose and duration needed to improve or stabilize neuroendocrine-immune function, as well as

%Mindfulness based stress reduction provides psychological benefit and restores immune function of women newly diagnosed with breast cancer: A randomized trial with active control.
%BACKGROUND: Women newly diagnosed with breast cancer experience psychological distress, accompanied by reduced Natural Killer Cell Activity (NKCA) and altered levels of cytokines, which may compromise cancer control. Few studies have evaluated psycho-immune outcomes of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer in comparison to an active control condition. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether MBSR benefits psychological, behavioral, and immunological function in women recently diagnosed with breast cancer. DESIGN: After confirmation of breast cancer staging, women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer (n = 192) were randomized to an 8-week MBSR program or an 8-week active control condition (ACC). The ACC consisted of a series of cancer recovery and health education classes. Both MBSR and the ACC were administered in group format. METHODS: Women completed psychometric instruments and provided blood for NKCA and cytokine levels at pre-, mid-, and completion of program, as well as at 1- and 6-months post-program. One hundred and twenty four women completed all five-assessments (MBSR, n = 63; ACC, n = 61). Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze trajectories of outcomes over time and between groups. 
%RESULTS: Compared to the ACC group, women randomized to MBSR exhibited decreasing trajectories of perceived stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms. 
%Further, compared to women randomized to ACC, MBSR women exhibited trajectories demonstrating significantly more rapid restoration of NKCA, accompanied by 
%lower circulating TNF-alpha levels, lower IL-6 production =>  pro-inflammatory cytokines
%and greater IFN-gamma production => IFN gamma supports an immune-mediated response against cancer and this may be important during the transition following cancer treatment
A randomized clinical trial with active control proved that early provision of MBSR for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer provides psychological benefits (reduction of stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms), and also optimizes immune functions (higher natural killer cell activity, higher \acrshort{ifng}, lower TNF-alpha, lower IL-6) supportive of cancer survival\citep{WitekJanusek2019}.

%The therapeutic relationship (TR) is essential towards spiritual care.
%According to clinical experience in healthcare, sometimes patients could tell the physicians: "How amazing it is. I want to talk about myself more when I visit this doctor whom I trust."
%In 1979, Carl Rogers wrote\citep{Rogers1979}: "I find that when I am closest to my inner, intuitive self, when I am somehow in touch with the unknown in me, when perhaps I am in a slightly altered state of consciousness, then whatever I do seems to be full of healing. Then simply my presence is releasing and helpful."
Carl Rogers developed person-centered theory that the therapist is providing the appropriate social-environmental conditions for their patients\citep{Rogers1957}\citep{Joseph2004}\citep{Griffiths2013}.
Person-centred theory holds that the innate tendency towards growth and development is facilitated by the six conditions described by Rogers in 1957\citep{Rogers1957}:\\
%For constructive personality change to occur, it is necessary that these conditions exist and continue over a period of time: 
1. Two persons are in psychological contact. \\
2. The first, whom we shall term the client, is in a state of incongruence (or not harmony), being vulnerable or anxious. \\
3. The second person, whom we shall term the therapist, is congruent
or integrated with the relationship. \\
4. The therapist experiences "unconditional positive regard" for the client. \\
5. The therapist experiences an empathic understanding of the client's
internal frame of reference and endeavors to communicate this experience to the client. \\
6. The communication to the client of the therapist's empathic understanding and unconditional positive regard is to a minimal degree achieved.\\

%As a person with hemophilia (PWH), my passion led me to conduct personal research to uncover the main cause of my drawbacks in my education, my career, and my romantic life. I have experienced unjustified conflicts in my social relations, feeling stale in mind and body
%Findings: Through my research, I uncovered that I used to suffer from what I call 'mind inhibitors' these were the hidden cause of my life disorders and spontaneous bleeds. These mind inhibitors are responsible for locking the body factor receptors, blocking body energy centres (like the solar plexus), discouraging the super-intelligent body cells from running their auto-healing system, and paralyzing the instinctive high-speed cellular response to external molecular treatment. 
%Mind inhibitors originate from different sources like thinking of oneself in a victim role, anxiety about medical treatments, lack of financial stability, negative attitudes, self-rejection, and contradictory thoughts and feelings. 
%Conclusion: Mind inhibitors should be handled as seriously as biological inhibitors. As Dr. Bruce Lipton explains in his book, 'The Biology of Belief'\citep{Lipton2015}: DNA does not control our biology; instead DNA is controlled by signals from outside the cell. Our bodies can be changed as we retrain our thinking, since thoughts are made of energy that affects the cellular energy level, and thus everything is created twice: once in our minds and then the physical creation follows. % 萬法唯心造
Holistic healthcare should be considered for treating patients as a complete synchronized system of soul, mind, and body; treatment should include more than medication or surgery, but a holistic approach would also address the patient's need for a subconscious paradigm shift in the person's thought and belief system.\citep{Kobisi2012}\citep{Lipton2015}

In our previous transtriptomics study\citep{Chi2020}, %\citep{Tai2007},
% from pvalueTex
the 9416 Kaplan-Meier plots with associated Cox's univariate and multivariate tables were generated by Cox modeling %(see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}) 
and justified by the ranking of hazard ratios.
The 967 genes were kept by criteria of uncorrected \textit{P} value (below 0.05) and \acrfull{hr} (greater than 1.5 or less than 0.5). %(see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(a) univariate, and Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(b) multivariate plots). 
At the final step, a stringent criteria (Bonferroni \textit{P} value correction) was used to yield twenty candidates. %(see Figure \ref{fig:figure2}(c), (d)). 
% before validation
Among these candidates, ten overexpressed genes (symbol as DKK1, CAMK2N1, STC2, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2, STIP1, and DKC1) are associated with a poor prognosis of  \acrshort{os}.% (see Table \ref{table:table1}). 
The other ten overexpressed genes (symbol as ZNF557, ZNF266, IL19, MYO1H, FCGBP, LOC148709, EVPLL, PNMA5, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.% (see Table \ref{table:table3}, with their gene name).
We made a volcano plot for 9416 genes by Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value (less than 0.05, obtained during cutoff finding procedure) against the Cox hazard ratio (see Figure \ref{fig:figure3}). The plot reveals that the most significant (Bonferroni-adjusted \textit{P} $< 0.05$) candidate genes are located above the dotted line. At the same time, Cox's HR separated them on the two-side with prognostic impact.
% => after validation: The result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

After validated by GSE2837, our top 1 candidate is \acrfull{CAMK2N1}. The Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 152 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{CAMK2N1} were suffered from only 35\% of 5-year \acrshort{os} rate. In comparison, the other 262 patients with lower expression (the cutoff at 0.027(RSEM)) had a better prognosis (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$) (see Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(a)).
Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(b)'s cumulative \textit{P} value plot shows that the uncorrected 147 \textit{P} values ($< 0.05$) have been estimated by a serial cut from 144 to 290 persons for grouping the cohort in our cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R, see Figure \ref{fig:figure1}, cutoff engine). The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{2.97e-7}), when cut on n=262 (63.3\% of 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value.
Conversely, the most associated gene with better survival is \acrfull{IL19}. In Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(c), a Kaplan-Meier curve reveals 215 patients bearing the higher expression of \acrshort{IL19} had 60\% of 5-year OS survival rate (adjusted \textit{P} = $0.002$). The cutoff finding procedure (cutofFinder\_func.R) generated cumulative \textit{P} value plot in Figure \ref{fig:figure4}(d). The 161 uncorrected \textit{P} values were estimated by a serial cut from 125 to 286 for grouping the cohort. The smallest \textit{P} value (\num{3.73e-7}), when cut on n=199 (48.1\% of total cohort 414), has been defined as an optimal \textit{P} value with a cutoff value -0.147(RSEM) of \acrshort{rnaseq}.
%The second candidate, which improving patient survival, is ZNF266.

%Table \ref{table:table1} shows ten overexpressed genes are associated with poor prognosis in \acrshort{hnscc}, ranked by adjusted Kaplan-Meier \textit{P} value.
Six out of ten preliminary candidates has been validated by using GSE2837.
We found those six candidates have the Cox's univariate and multivariate HR above 1.914.
%There were few published articles of \acrfull{SURF4} and \acrfull{NDFIP1} (\acrshort{NEDD4}: \acrlong{NEDD4}), which were related to cancer research.
In Table \ref{table:table2}, % table 3
after adjustment of confounders, \acrshort{CAMK2N1} overexpression is the independent prognostic factor (multivariate HR 2.007 [95\% CI: 1.490-2.704, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]), as well as clinical T stage (HR 1.982 [95\% CI: 1.048-3.745, \textit{P} = 0.035]) and surgical margins status (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.182-2.250, \textit{P} = 0.003]). 
Older age (more than 65) also worse the survival (HR 1.391 [95\% CI: 1.025-1.888, \textit{P} = 0.034]). 
The M stage could be ignored in this cohort due to only 3 out of 414 patients with distant metastasis.

%In Table \ref{table:table3}, the other ten overexpressed genes have been found in better prognosis of \acrshort{hnscc} patients. Cox's univariate and multivariate HR is under 0.5.
%Four out of ten has been validated by using GSE2837.
In Table \ref{table:table4},
after adjustment of confounders, prognosis is influenced by advance clinical T Status (HR 1.961 [95\% CI: 1.035-3.714, \textit{P} = 0.039] ), positive surgical margin involvement (HR 1.631 [95\% CI: 1.18-2.254, \textit{P} = 0.003]) , and higher tobacco exposure (HR 1.453 [95\% CI: 1.055-2.000, \textit{P} = 0.022]).
Overexpressed \acrshort{IL19} gene could has a protective influencce on prognosis (HR 0.499 [95\% CI: 0.372-0.669, \textit{P} $<$ 0.001]).


In summary, those ten candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc}.
Thus, the prognosis model with coefficients is established from \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort. 
%The important input $X_1...X_n$ should be patients' features: age, specific ten gene expressions, clinical T stage, and surgical margin.

% After validation with an independent \acrshort{hnscc} cohort (GSE2837), the result showed six overexpressed genes (symbol as CAMK2N1, PGK1, SURF4, USP10, NDFIP1, FOXA2) are significantly associated with a poor prognosis of overall survival. 
%Furthermore, the four overexpressed genes (symbol as IL19, FCGBP, IQCN - former symbol as KIAA1683, and NPB) are correlated with better survival.

\section{Deep Learning in Bioinformatics}

%why deep learning?
According to the recommendation of \acrfull{nci} (accessed at https://www.cancer.gov/\\research/areas/diagnosis/artificial-intelligence), 
\begin{outline}
\1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) is helpful to create opportunities in cancer research
\1 Image-based phenotype of cancer could be correlated with their underlying genomics data by deep learning methods
%Deep learning could predict commonly mutated genes and mRNA expression from the images
%\1 Aiding the genomics characterization of tumors by AI is crucial
\end{outline}

%== NCI deep learning could predict commonly mutated genes from the images:
Deep learning can be used to identify specific gene mutations and mRNA expression from tumor pathology images instead of using traditional genomic sequencing. 
For instance, NCI-funded researchers\citep{Coudray2018} at New York University used deep learning to analyze pathology images of lung tumors obtained from \acrfull{tcia}.
% Michael Snyder, Ph.D., chair of genetics at Stanford University, sees AI as the future of diagnosis. “I think we need to shift to using machine learning rather than rely on pathologists alone to do all the work,” he said. “Algorithms won’t replace pathologists, but they will assist them in making classifications. They will reduce the errors that pathologists would otherwise make.”
%The code developed for the project is available for other researchers to use for other diagnostic applications. The NYU team has already started applying the code to learn to diagnose kidney, breast, and other cancers.
The \acrshort{tcia} archives pathology images of tumor specimens available as a quality control measure for researchers studying the genetic sequence data collected in the \acrshort{tcga} project.
Coudray and his colleagues found that the deep learning method could accurately distinguish between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma from the images\citep{Coudray2018}.
%how machine learning could help us?

%https://github.com/Serian1992/ImgBio.
%https://www.cancer.gov/research/areas/diagnosis/artificial-intelligence
Since a deep learning algorithm could potentially extract molecular phenotype from pathology images, 
mRNA expression could also be predicted from the images.
A HE2RNA model, developed by Schmauch and his colleagues\citep{Schmauch2020},  could predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images of \acrshort{tcia}. 
It has been validated by CD3- and CD20-\acrshort{ihc} staining. 
The transcriptomic representation learned by HE2RNA can also be transferred on other datasets.
%MKI67 is a well-known marker of cell proliferation, expressed both by tumor and adjacent normal cells, clinically determined by MIB1 or Ki67 IHC staining of whole-slide images. 
%  its surrounding cancerous area 
%Its overexpression around "surgical margin?" has been found to correlate with tumor growth, histological grade, and tumor recurrence.
% A high expression level of MKI67 is correlated with the most advanced stages of liver cancer.






\section{Conclusion}
High-throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is a powerful tool to characterize and quantify transcriptomes. Even the cost of RNA-Seq is continuously dropping, 
the budget of whole-genome transcriptomics study for survival analysis is still very high (USD350 to 500 per sample; 46 participants of HNSCC in TMU Joint Biobank, accessed on \today at http://ohr.tmu.edu.tw/front/jbb1/CaseNumber/pages.php?\\ID=dG11X29ociZDYXNlTnVtYmVy).
% NCI HE2RNA
By using the transcriptomic representation of RNA-Seq learned by NCI's HE2RNA project\citep{Schmauch2020},
%TCIA for whole-slide deep learning
we could validate and find more biomarkers from holistic \acrshort{ehr} and pathology images by the way of deep learning under R/Pytorch/Keras framework.

%the ability of HE2RNA to focus specifically on cancer-related molecular information\citep{Schmauch2020}.
% detailed introduction
%*** A deep learning model to predict RNA-Seq expression of tumours from whole-slide images\cite{Schmauch2020}.
%A HE2RNA model should be trained to systematically predict RNA-Seq profiles from whole-slide images\cite{Schmauch2020}.
% . The application of deep-learning algo- rithms to histological
The whole-slide images of pathology data has the high dimensionality (up to 100,000 × 100,000 pixels for a single image).
%The small size of available datasets. => small case number
HE2RNA workflow could divide the whole-slide images into squares of 112 × 112 $\mu$m (224 × 224 pixels) called "tiles", and use the Otsu algorithm\citep{Otsu1979} (as implemented in python package scikit-image, available at https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.html) to select only those containing tissue, excluding the white background. 
A maximum of 8000 such tiles from each slide are sampled then extracted 2048 features with a 50-layer ResNet model\citep{He2016a}  pretrained on the ImageNet dataset (available at https://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/index.php).
The ResNet and HE2RNA model are developed by using the TensorFlow/Keras implementation with a architecture of \acrfull{cnn}.
%Graph convolutional neural network (GCNN).
The AI-driven computer program analyzes tissue by creating a map of thousands of tiles.
A pathology slide could be represented as a 8000 × 2048 matrix.
%For the first phase of this work (transcriptome prediction), we accelerated the training of our models through a simple preprocessing step inspired by simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC)65: 
We use the k-means algorithm (as implemented in python package libkmcuda) to create 100 clusters (supertiles) of tiles on the basis of tile location on the slide, and we average the features of the tiles within each cluster. The use of these supertiles could reduce the dimensions of a slide to 100 × 2048. % training supertiles
Transcriptome prediction model will be first trained on this reduced dataset, with all the TCGA data. Then, fine-tuning of "hyperparameters" will be achieved with full-scale data from \acrshort{hnscc} dataset by Bayesian optimization technique (Sequential Model-Based Optimization algorithms, SMBO)\citep{Hutter2011}.
The similar procedure of image process will be applied on TMU dataset.\\[0.5cm]

%Graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) will be used for feature extraction from whole-slide images.

%% TCGA new holistic features %%%%%
%Our previous \acrshort{hnscc} study\cite{Chi2020} 
Our preliminary research data summarizes that 20 candidate biomarkers, clinical T stage, and surgical margin are independent prognosis factors.
The prognosis model with coefficients is established from \acrshort{tcga} \acrshort{hnscc} cohort. The important input $X_1...X_n$ should be patients' features: age, candidate gene expressions, clinical T stage, and surgical margin so far.
When we consider the survival prediction model in a holistic manner,
ground truth Y (e.x. patient's survival):\\[0.5cm]
%Y$:\\[0.3cm]
$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3 + ... + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$\\[0.3cm]
Actually, gene expression is not an independent $X_{mrna}$. It could be influenced with other factors (for example):\\[0.3cm]
$X_{body}, X_{stress}, X_{fear}, X_{meaningOfLife}, X_{inflammation}, X_{empathy}$\\[0.3cm]
That is because there is much work to be done in investigating the functional mind-body network\citep{Rogers1959}.
%We wish the TCGA does collect more holistic features from their participants in the future.

%癌症與身心靈的重要關係：中醫、citation? emotional centered approach
We suggest TCGA should cover more holistic features:
The cortisol is one of the most common objective outcomes studied in psychoneuroimmunological (PNI) factor. Interleukin, cytokines, lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+), CD56+, vitals signs, telomere length, telomere activity, and heart rate variability (HRV) are others.
The subjective psychosocial measures should include depression, stress, quality of life, anxiety, fatigue, mindfulness, mood, and specific spiritual growth (i.e., the meaning of life)\citep{Hsiao2012}.
%冤親債主的意念 unknown X factors 回到我們的文章
Since psychological benefit (reduction of stress, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive symptoms) also optimizes immune function (higher natural killer cell activity, higher \acrshort{ifng}, lower TNF-alpha, lower IL-6) in terms of better survival of patients from cancer.

% holistic EHR
Moreover, we encourage physicians to write their \acrshort{ehr} in a "holistic way".
% Deep Patient:  
Thus, deep learning can convert EHR to the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) format\citep{Rajkomar2018}\citep{HealthLevelSeven2019} for handling free-text notes by physicians.
Deep learning can also derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions\citep{Miotto2016}.

Once the holistic feature is available, a graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) is mandatory for further survival analysis\citep{Ching2018a}.

In Taipei Medical University Hospital, holistic-enabled EHR has been designed in the daily-work for charting our outpatients with psycho-social-spiritual evaluation\citep{Ling-ChengMong2021}:\\

The Cox proportional hazards regression is the widely accepted approach for modeling survival while accounting for confounding factors\cite{Magen2019}. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression model\cite{Andersen1982}, using the "coxph" function in R package "survival", will be applied to calculate hazard ratio, \acrfull{ci95} and its significance, and to estimate the independent contributions of each clinicopathological features to the overall survival.
Results are considered statistically significant when a two-sided \textit{P} value $<$ 0.05, or a lower threshold if indicated.
The \acrfull{fdr} ($< 0.05$) could be used to pick up the optimal \textit{P} value to ensure the control for type I error of multiple survival test during the survival analysis.
%There were also multiple correlated tests of null hypotheses in the Kaplan-Meier family during our global scanning of protein-coding genes. The stringent Bonferroni correction could result in an adjusted \textit{P} value to ensure the control for type I error. 

%Cox regression tables, were exported to ".xlsx" and ".Rda" files (by R package "r2excel") for subsequent biomarker selection.



The candidate biomarkers, clinical tumor size, surgical margin status and some holistic features will be suggested as prognosis factors in \acrshort{hnscc} through analysis of TCGA and TMU datasets.
%The transcriptomic representation of \acrfull{tcia} and TCGA could be applied to validate those candidates by independent TMU cohort.

%We will find that \acrshort{rnaseq} (or \acrshort{rnaseq} representation with associated pathological images) and holistic features will help to facilitate the biomarker discovery in \acrshort{hnscc}.

chronic inflammation by mechanical force or chemicals

** or even in autoimmune disease:
Risks from disease and treatment
Autoimmune disorders generally attack a single organ or part of the body, often causing inflammation in the affected area. In some cases, that inflammation may increase cancer risk. 
At the same time, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or immunosuppressant (e.x. cyclosporin), help reduce inflammation and also are suspected of increasing the risk of multiple cancers. It may impair the ability to kill cancer cells.

two of ten hallmarks: avoiding immune destruction, tumor-promoting inflammation \citep{Ohman2015}



The basic principles that guide cancer immunology are immune surveillance \citep{BURNET1957, Shankaran2001}, immune editing, and immune tolerance.
%immunosurveillance
Peritumoral immune responses might predict patients’ prognosis in a wide range of cancers. Beyond local accumulation, systemic immune response in serum is seen in patients with \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Lee2010a}.
% immunoediting 敵消我長的過程
Moreover, the immune response is not only achieving protection of the host but also editing the immunogenicity of tumours \citep{Dunn2002}.
The cancer immunoediting includes elimination, equilibrium then escape.
%elimination by immunosurveillance
The cells, which have aberrant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, will be eliminated by cytotoxic mechanism or induction of apoptosis by immune cells, involving granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), macrophages, natural
killer cells, in innate immunity \citep{Tallerico2013}.
Tumour-associated macrophages include  M1, which has antitumoral properties, and M2, which has tumour-promoting phenotype in \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Kumar2019}.

Through dendritic cells presenting the tumor antigens to T helper cells in context with MHC class II molecules, naive or memory T cells will conduct activation of  T cells and adaptive immunity \citep{Banchereau2000}. 
The plasmacytoid cells are a subtype of dendritic cells that are one of the main sources of secreting \acrshort{ifng}. 
T cells consist of at least five subgroups: Th1 (CD4+), Th2 (CD4+), Th17 (CD4+), regulatory T cells (CD4+ CD25+ Tregs), and cytotoxic T cells (CD8+). 
Cytotoxic T cells is triggered by helper T cells to attack directly and execute those tumor cells, whose antigen is presented by dendritic cells, via effector molecules such as perforin and granzyme. Cytotoxic T cells also use TRAIL receptor to release signal on tumor's FasL to induce cell apoptosis.
% By inducing intracellular signaling through lck, the CD8 coreceptor is an important factor affecting TCR‐mediated T cell activation and modulation of immunosuppression and cytotoxicity.
All subsets play important roles in mucosal immune response, including antitumoral responses. T cells represent approximately 10\% of the total cells in a tumour mass \citep{Balkwill2012}.

% equilibrium under immunoselection:  Cancer cells avoid immunosurveillance by the selection of non-immunogenic tumour-cell variants % 鄭爺爺
***When immunosurveillance systems are not able to eradicate the tumor cells, the result may be tumor dormancy, where an equilibrium with defending cells occurs.

equilibrium represents a time of tumour cell persistence without progression.
equilibrium is maintained solely by adaptive immunity
The interplay of the potentially malignant cells and immune cells from immunosurveillance, equilibrium to tumor escape.
Lymphocytes of adaptive immunity have the capacity to take over and exert enough antitumoral effects to kill and limit tumour growth, and the tumour is thus kept in their dormitory \citep{Koebel2007}.
The tumour cells in equilibrium are highly immunogenic (unedited), whereas those spontaneously exiting equilibrium (escape) that become growing tumours have attenuated immunogenicity (edited)—results that place this process temporally between elimination and escape \citep{Koebel2007}.
maintaining cancer in an equilibrium state may represent a relevant goal of cancer immunotherapy in which augmentation of adaptive tumour immunity could result in improved tumour control. *** A TREATMENT GOALS
%the downregulation or loss of expression of HLA class I molecules
% decoy receptors for TRAIL: DcR3, Decoy receptor 3 (DcR3), to prevent FasR-FasL interactions by competitively binding to membrane-bound Fas ligand; FasL binds to DcR3 (TNFRSF6B) without TRAIL function 假的誘餌
% Death receptors:  tumour-necrosis-factor (TNF) receptor 1, CD95 (also known as FAS) and two receptors for TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAILR1 and TRAILR2).


% escape under immunesubversion: by the active suppression of the immune response
Escape is the process wherein the immunologically sculpted tumor expands in an uncontrolled manner in the immunocompetent host \citep{Dunn2002, Dunn2004}.
It was suggested by increasing the presence of Tregs in terms of suppression of Th1 and cytotoxic T cells response by \acrfull{ctla4} \citep{Halvorsen2014}.
Moreover, myelo-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs, CD34+) could also down-regulation of granzyme from T cells in \acrshort{hnscc} \citep{Si2019}.
The antitumoral effect of adaptive immunity also help to the tumour evolution. It lets tumour cells to modify immunogenicity to avoid immune recognition, and to resist the cytotoxicity of T cells.
The activated oncogenes can trigger 1) DNA-damage sensors, [such as ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3 related)]; 2) checkpoint kinases, [such as CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1 homologue) and CHK2]; 3) and the tumour-suppressor protein p53. 
The transcription factor, p53, that is activated by many genotoxic insults and induces cellular apoptosis. The gene TP53, encoding p53, is frequently mutated or functionally inactivated in cancer cells.
Through suppression of the DNA-damage response by above mechanisms, tumor cells might downregulation of NKG2D ligands (\acrshort{mica}, \acrshort{micb}) to avoid recognition by NKG2D-expressing NK cells, natural killer T (NKT) cells, $\gamma\delta$ T cells and some cytolytic CD8+ $\alpha\beta$ T cells \citep{Ljunggren2007}. They also express PD‐L1 and Fas ligand to suppress cytotoxic T cells \citep{Zitvogel2006}. Thus, the cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair or apoptosis (aka. DNA-damage response) of tumor cells will be inhibited.
The activation of $\acrshort{tgf}\beta$ in terms of promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
%IL-10
% Activation of the DNA-damage response by cell-intrinsic stimuli (oncogene activation or reactive oxygen species, ROS) or therapy activates the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated)–CHK1 (checkpoint kinase 1 homologue) pathway. This pathway leads either to p53- or NKG2D- (ligand: MICA or MICB) dependent apoptosis of tumour cells.
% NKG2D (Natural-killer group 2, member D). A lectin-type activating receptor that is encoded by the NK complex and is expressed at the surface of NK cells, NKT cells, γδ T cells and some cytolytic CD8+ αβ T cells. 
% The ligands for NKG2D are MHC-class-I-polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) and MICB in humans; and retinoic acid early transcript 1 (RAE1) and H60 in mice

Finally, tumor cells have downregulated homing receptors, and malformation of peripheral vacularity. It causes hypoxia and increased interstitial pressure which lead to a hostile microenvironment for against the infiltrating defense cells \citep{Ljunggren2007}.

Evasion of apoptosis contributes to the acquisition of initial oncogenesis, resistance to chemotherapy and to immune effectors
The apoptotic program is carried out through two main pathways: the mitochondrial pathway, which involves mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP)61; and the death-receptor pathway, which involves ligation of a plasma-membrane receptor, leading to the formation of a death-inducing signalling complex (DISC).

% a long way to go becoming cancer
Chronic inflammation is a risk factor in promoting carcinogenesis. The persistent inflammation in oral lichen planus (with reticular striations) was found that the influx of T helper, cytotoxic T cells, and B cells were increased in oral mucosa with moderate to severe dysplasia and oral squamous cell carcinoma compared to normal or mild dysplasia \citep{Gannot2002}. The infiltration of T cells and dendritic cells were also found in oral lichen planus \citep{Lorenzini2013}.
The incidence of malignant transformation of oral lichen planus is approximately 0.5–1.5\% \citep{Bermejo-Fenoll2009}, while oral leukoplakia is about 10\%.
